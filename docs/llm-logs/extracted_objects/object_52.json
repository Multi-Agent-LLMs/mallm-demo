The step-by-step breakdown of the calculation is correct, and the application of the formula for the future value of a series of periodic payments (annuity) is accurate.\n\nThe Accountant's cross-check further confirms the correctness of the solution by performing the calculation step-by-step and obtaining the same result, $205.10.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement to the solution by providing a more detailed explanation of the formula and its components, as well as rounding considerations.\n\nThe formula for the future value of a series of periodic payments (annuity) is:\n\nFV = PMT * (((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1) / (r/n))\n\nWhere:\n- FV = Future Value (the amount Mrs. Hilton wants to save) = $10,000\n- PMT = Periodic payment (the quarterly deposit we're trying to find)\n- r = Annual interest rate = 5% = 0.05\n- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year = 4 (since it's quarterly)\n- t = Time the money is invested for, in years = 10 years\n\nTo solve for PMT, we rearrange the formula as follows:\n\nPMT = FV * (r/n) / (((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1))\n\nThe key to this formula is understanding the components:\n\n* The term (1 + r/n) represents the growth factor for each period (quarter, in this case).\n* The exponent (n*t) represents the total number of periods (quarters) over the 10-year period.\n* The denominator (r/n) / (((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1)) represents the present value of the annuity, which is then multiplied by the future value (FV) to find the periodic payment (PMT).\n\nIn terms of rounding, the solution is accurate to two decimal places, which is sufficient for most financial calculations. However, if desired, the calculation can be performed to a greater number of decimal places for increased precision.\n\nOverall, the solution is correct, and I agree with the answer:\n\nE) $205.10",
