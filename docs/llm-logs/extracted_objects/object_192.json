Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nLet's recap the final solution:\n\n**Expected Return of an Equal-Weighted Portfolio**\n\nThe expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%. This demonstrates that the average formula can be a convenient and easy-to-use method for calculating the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

The writing is clear, and the tone is professional and suitable for an investment or finance discussion.\n\nI do not have any suggestions for improvement, as the solution is comprehensive and user-friendly.\n\nThe final solution remains:\n\n**Expected Return of an Equal-Weighted Portfolio**\n\nThe expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

While the average formula is a convenient and easy-to-use method for calculating the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio, it should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. In cases where the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used.\n\nHere is the improved solution with the suggested addition:\n\n**Expected Return of an Equal-Weighted Portfolio**\n\nThe expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal.

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nThis improved solution clarifies why both methods can be used to calculate the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio and highlights the importance of equal weights in simplifying the weighted average formula to the average formula."

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nThis solution is a step-by-step guide on how to calculate the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C using two different methods: the weighted average formula and the average formula."

Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case.

Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"

Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"

If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"

Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal.

If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nThis improved solution clarifies why both methods can be used to calculate the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio and highlights the importance of equal weights in simplifying the weighted average formula to the average formula."

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"

While the average formula is a convenient and easy-to-use method for calculating the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio, it should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. In cases where the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used.\n\nHere is the improved solution with the suggested addition:\n\n**Expected Return of an Equal-Weighted Portfolio**\n\nThe expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nThis improved solution clarifies why both methods can be used to calculate the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio and highlights the importance of equal weights in simplifying the weighted average formula to the average formula."

The writing is clear, and the tone is professional and suitable for an investment or finance discussion.\n\nI do not have any suggestions for improvement, as the solution is comprehensive and user-friendly.\n\nThe final solution remains:\n\n**Expected Return of an Equal-Weighted Portfolio**\n\nThe expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is 6%, which corresponds to option G.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%\n\nI hope this improved solution is helpful.\n\nThe conversation is now complete.",

This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"

If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%",

Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n2. Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n3. The portfolio is equal-weighted, with each security having a 50% weight.\n4. Two methods can be used to calculate the expected return: the weighted average formula and the average formula.\n\n**Why Both Methods Work**\n\nIn an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has the same weight, which is 50% in this case. Since the weights are equal, the weighted average formula simplifies to the average formula. This means that we can calculate the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio using either the weighted average formula or the average formula, as both will yield the same result.\n\n**Note on the Limitations of the Average Formula**\n\nIt's essential to note that the average formula should only be used when the weights of the securities are equal. If the weights are not equal, the weighted average formula should be used to calculate the expected return.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Weighted Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the weight of each security in the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, each security has a 50% weight.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nExpected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C)\nExpected return = (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%)\nExpected return = 0.5 * (7 + 5)\nExpected return = 0.5 * 12\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Method 2: Using the Average Formula**\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected returns of Securities A and C.\n- Security A has an expected return of 7%.\n- Security C has an expected return of 5%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio.\nSince it's an equal-weighted portfolio, we can simply take the average of the expected returns of Securities A and C:\nExpected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2\nExpected return = (7% + 5%) / 2\nExpected return = (0.07 + 0.05) / 2\nExpected return = 0.12 / 2\nExpected return = 6%\n\n**Benefits of Using the Average Formula in Equal-Weighted Portfolios**\n\nUsing the average formula in equal-weighted portfolios has several benefits, including:\n\n* Simplified calculations: The average formula simplifies the calculation of the expected return, making it easier to calculate and understand.\n* Faster results: The average formula provides faster results, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weighted average.\n* Improved accuracy: The average formula reduces the risk of errors, as it eliminates the need to calculate the weights and multiply them by the expected returns.\n\n**Comparison of the Two Methods**\n\n| Method | Formula | Calculation | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weighted Average Formula | Expected return = (Weight of Security A * Expected return of Security A) + (Weight of Security C * Expected return of Security C) | (0.5 * 7%) + (0.5 * 5%) = 6% | 6% |\n| Average Formula | Expected return = (Expected return of Security A + Expected return of Security C) / 2 | (7% + 5%) / 2 = 6% | 6% |\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: the expected return of the equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is indeed 6%.\n\nThe solution remains: G) 6%"
