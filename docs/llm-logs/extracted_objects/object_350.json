      "message": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm",

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

            "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

            "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

        "message": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm",

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

              "content": "Data Analyst: [DISAGREE]\n\nWhile the Optics Specialist's explanation is thorough and generally well-executed, there's a small error in the calculations. \n\nThe error is in the rounding of the actual \u0394\u03bb. When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm.

Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm.

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm.

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1).

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm.

Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm.

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

              "content": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

              "content": "Data Analyst: [DISAGREE]\n\nWhile the Optics Specialist's explanation is thorough and generally well-executed, there's a small error in the calculations. \n\nThe error is in the rounding of the actual \u0394\u03bb. When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1).

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point. Since 0.5 nm is half the actual difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, we need to consider that \u0394\u03bb should be twice that, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nHowever, the step in between should be more precisely treated. Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.

Since 0.5 nm is already the half of \u0394\u03bb then \u0394\u03bb equals just 0.5 nm * 2, which leads to \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nBut there is another, even more precise way of calculating \u0394\u03bb in the correct solution:\n\u0394\u03bb = 0.5 nm * 2 \n\u0394\u03bb = 1 nm\n\n\n itensely speaking that \u03bb1 = 676 - 0.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676 + 0.5 nm\n\n\n\u03bb1 = 675.5 nm\n\n\u03bb2 = 676.5 nm\n\n\nTherefore, although the conclusion that \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm is correct, the calculations are correct up to that point.\n\nHowever the final result could have been interpreted as:\n\n\nA) 675.74 and 676.26\n\nas well because a = (676 - 0.52), b = (676 + 0.52).

              "content": "Optics Specialist: To solve this problem, we can utilize the principles of interferometry, specifically the concept of fringe contrast variation in a Michelson interferometer. When the mirror is moved, the path difference between the two arms changes, affecting the fringe contrast.\n\nLet's denote the average wavelength of the doublet as \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, and the two wavelengths of the doublet as \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe are given that the periodic variations of fringe contrast occur whenever one of the mirrors is moved through a distance of 0.44 mm. This distance is half the coherence length of the doublet, as it's the distance over which the contrast is maximum again. Therefore, the coherence length of the doublet is 2 \u00d7 0.44 mm = 0.88 mm.\n\nIn an interferometer, the coherence length (l_c) of a light source is related to its spectral width (\u0394\u03bb) and central wavelength (\u03bb) by:\n\nl_c = \u03bb^2 / \u0394\u03bb\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nRearrange the equation to find \u0394\u03bb:\n\n\u0394\u03bb = \u03bb^2 / l_c\n\u0394\u03bb = (676 \u00d7 10^(-9) m)^2 / (0.88 \u00d7 10^(-3) m)\n\u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm\n\nHowever, this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb because 0.5 nm is half the actual difference \u03bb1 - \u03bb2 (or \u03bb2 - \u03bb1). The actual \u0394\u03bb between \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is twice that, so \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm.\n\nNow we have \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm. Since \u03bb_avg = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2) / 2 = 676 nm, we can deduce the values of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nWe can either:\n1) Subtract 0.5 nm from \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb1 and add 0.5 nm to \u03bb_avg to find \u03bb2, or,\n2) Use the average \u03bb_avg = 676 nm, which is the midpoint of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb_avg + (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm + 0.5 nm\n= 676.5 nm\n\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb_avg - (\u0394\u03bb / 2)\n= 676 nm - 0.5 nm\n= 675.5 nm\n\nTherefore, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the solution should be \u03bb1 = 675.5 nm and \u03bb2 = 676.5 nm.\n\nWith the above calculations, the answer should be:\n\nI) 676.5 nm and 675.5 nm"

When calculating \u0394\u03bb, the Optics Specialist finds \u0394\u03bb \u2248 0.5 \u00d7 10^(-9) m or 0.5 nm. However, when explaining that this is only half the actual \u0394\u03bb, the conclusion that the actual \u0394\u03bb = 1 nm is correct, but this conclusion was jumped to hastily and is correct.\n\nWhat is not noticed is the value 0.5 nm. Actually, the calculations are correct up to that point.
