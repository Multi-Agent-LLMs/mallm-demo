The key points outlined are clear and concise, and they perfectly summarize the reasoning behind the answer.\n\nLet's break it down step by step, as you suggested:\n\n1. Malcolm X's lifetime (1925-1965): This is a historical fact that sets the stage for our analysis.\n2. The introduction of Unicode in 1991: Another historical fact that provides a clear timeline for the development of Unicode.\n3. The impossibility of Malcolm X using Unicode due to the timeline: This is the logical conclusion based on the previous two points. Given that Malcolm X passed away in 1965 and Unicode was introduced in 1991, it's clear that he couldn't have used it.\n\nThe evidence is clear, and the discussion has been respectful and thorough. I don't see any need for further improvements, as the conclusion is well-supported and easy to understand. Therefore, I agree with the current solution: B) No. Malcolm X did not use Unicode."
