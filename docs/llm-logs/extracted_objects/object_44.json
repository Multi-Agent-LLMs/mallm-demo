The rephrased statement \"any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming\" is more accurate and clear.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n\"Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is the additional amount saved when income increases by one dollar, while Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is the additional amount consumed when income increases by one dollar.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in recognizing that when marginal propensity to save (MPS) equals marginal propensity to consume (MPC), any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. As a result, A. T. Hun's additional income of $1000 will be allocated, with $500 going towards saving and $500 towards consuming.\n\nGiven this understanding, the step-by-step solution remains the same:\n\n1. MPS = MPC (Given in the problem)\n2. MPC + MPS = $1000 (Total increase in income is $1000)\n3. Since MPS = MPC, let's call both 'x'. So, x + x = $1000\n4. Combining like terms: 2x = $1000\n5. Dividing both sides by 2: x = $500\n\nSolution: J) $500. This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming, resulting in A. T. Hun saving $500 of the additional $1000.\n\nIn conclusion, the equality of MPS and MPC has important implications for understanding consumer behavior, as it suggests that any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. This highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nSolution: J) $500\n\nThis improved solution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nBy adding this brief statement, the solution becomes more comprehensive and provides a clearer understanding of the implications of MPS = MPC for consumption and saving behavior.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the improved solution above.",

T.

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T.

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

MPS = MPC (Given in the problem)\n2. MPC + MPS = $1000 (Total increase in income is $1000)\n3. Since MPS = MPC, let's call both 'x'. So, x + x = $1000\n4. Combining like terms: 2x = $1000\n5. Dividing both sides by 2: x = $500\n\nSolution: J) $500. This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming, resulting in A. T. Hun saving $500 of the additional $1000.\n\nIn conclusion, the equality of MPS and MPC has important implications for understanding consumer behavior, as it suggests that any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. This highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nSolution: J) $500\n\nThis improved solution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nI suggest that this solution is final and no further improvements are needed.",

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming, resulting in A. T. Hun saving $500 of the additional $1000.\n\nIn conclusion, the equality of MPS and MPC has important implications for understanding consumer behavior, as it suggests that any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. This highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nSolution: J) $500\n\nThis improved solution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nI suggest that this solution is final and no further improvements are needed.",

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming, resulting in A. T. Hun saving $500 of the additional $1000.\n\nIn conclusion, the equality of MPS and MPC has important implications for understanding consumer behavior, as it suggests that any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. This highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nSolution: J) $500\n\nThis improved solution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nI suggest that this solution is final and no further improvements are needed.",

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming, resulting in A. T. Hun saving $500 of the additional $1000.\n\nIn conclusion, the equality of MPS and MPC has important implications for understanding consumer behavior, as it suggests that any increase in income will lead to an equal increase in both saving and consuming. This highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nSolution: J) $500\n\nThis improved solution provides a more comprehensive understanding of the concept and highlights the importance of considering both MPS and MPC in analyzing consumption and saving behavior.\n\nI suggest that this solution is final and no further improvements are needed.",

T. Hun's marginal propensity to save equals his marginal propensity to consume, it means that for every extra dollar he earns, he spends and saves an equal amount. \n\nSo, given the extra $1000 he made this year, we can say that his MPC = MPS = x, and x + x = 1000 because the total amount is $1000 (the sum of spending and saving). \n\nCombine like terms, and you will see that 2x = $1000.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, you see that x = $500.\n\nSince we are interested in the amount saved (MPS), the answer is 500 dollars, which is his extra income saved when he earns an additional $1000.\n\nSolution: J"

MPS = MPC (Given in the problem)\n2. MPC + MPS = $1000 (Total increase in income is $1000)\n3. Since MPS = MPC, let's call both 'x'. So, x + x = $1000\n4. Combining like terms: 2x = $1000\n5. Dividing both sides by 2: x = $500\n\nSolution: J) $500. This demonstrates that when MPS equals MPC, the increase in income is split equally between saving and consuming, resulting in A. T.
