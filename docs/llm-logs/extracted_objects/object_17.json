In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

        "message": "To find the answer, let's first understand what \"81 squared\" means. In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81. And, square root of 81 is 9 (since 9 * 9 = 81).\n\nHence, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)",

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81. And, square root of 81 is 9 (since 9 * 9 = 81).\n\nHence, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)"

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81. And, square root of 81 is 9 (since 9 * 9 = 81).\n\nHence, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)"

              "content": "To find the answer, let's first understand what \"81 squared\" means. In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81. And, square root of 81 is 9 (since 9 * 9 = 81).\n\nHence, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)"

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81. And, square root of 81 is 9 (since 9 * 9 = 81).\n\nHence, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)"

In mathematical notation, \"squared\" refers to raising a number to the power of 2, or in other words, multiplying the number by itself. Therefore, \"81 squared\" is equal to 81 * 81, which equals 6561.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the square root of 81 squared, not the squared value itself. The square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Since we are looking for the square root of \"81 squared,\" let's first find the squared value of 81.\n\n81 squared = 81 * 81 = 6561\n\nNow, we are asked to find the square root of 6561, which essentially leads us to the original number before squaring, as the square root and the squared cancel each other out. Therefore, the square root of 6561 (which is 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81 before being squared.\n\n\nThe square root of 6561 (result of 81 squared) would be the same as the square root of 81.

Since the question asks for the square root of 81 squared, we can simplify this by recognizing that the square root and the squared operation are inverses. This means that the square root \"reverses\" the effect of squaring, allowing us to return to the original value. In other words, when you square a number, you get a new value, and when you take the square root of that new value, you get back to the original number. Therefore, we're looking for the square root of the original value, 81.\n3. The square root of 81 is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 81. This number is 9, since 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 81 squared equals 9.\n\nSolution: J)"
