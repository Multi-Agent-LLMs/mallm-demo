A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent. We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n\n\nGiven the ratio 3:8, we need to find another ratio (a/b) such that (a/b) = (3/8). We'll analyze and compare each option:\n\n\nA) 24 over 64\nB) 15 over 48\nC) 18 over 56\nD) 18 over 40\n\n\nOption A, 24 over 64, is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8). We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8.

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\n18/56 = (18/2)/(56/2) = 9/28\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/28 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (56 * 3) = 144 / 168 = 6/7 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option C (18 over 56) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.",

A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent. We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n\nGiven the ratio 3:8, we need to find another ratio (a/b) such that (a/b) = (3/8). We'll analyze and compare each option:\n\nA) 24 over 64 \nB) 15 over 48 \nC) 18 over 56 \nD) 18 over 40 \n\nOption A, 24 over 64, is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8). We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8.

We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8.

We'll analyze and compare each option:\n\n\nA) 24 over 64\nB) 15 over 48\nC) 18 over 56\nD) 18 over 40\n\n\nOption A, 24 over 64, is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8). We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8. The correct answer is:\n\n\n**Summary of Key Points:**\n\n*   A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent.\n*   We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n*   Option A (24 over 64) is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8).\n*   Option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8 because it is not a multiple of 3/8 and cross-multiplication results in an inequality.\n\n\n**Improved Solution:**\n\nTo further enhance the solution, we could add a few more examples of incorrect options, analyzing them in a similar manner to demonstrate why they do not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\nFor example, let's analyze option C, 18 over 56. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\n18/56 = (18/2)/(56/2) = 9/28\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/28 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (56 * 3) = 144 / 168 = 6/7 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option C (18 over 56) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.",

        "message": "[DISAGREE]\n\nAlthough the polished solution provided is clear, concise, and accurate, I believe that adding an example of an incorrect option, as suggested, would further enhance the solution by providing a more comprehensive understanding of proportions and equivalent ratios.\n\nHowever, instead of simply comparing option A (24 over 64) to option B (15 over 48), I propose that we analyze option B (15 over 48) in more detail, explaining why it doesn't match the proportion 3:8.\n\nHere's an improved solution:\n\nThe problem asks for a ratio that forms a proportion with 3 over 8. A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent. We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n\nGiven the ratio 3:8, we need to find another ratio (a/b) such that (a/b) = (3/8). We'll analyze and compare each option:\n\nA) 24 over 64 \nB) 15 over 48 \nC) 18 over 56 \nD) 18 over 40 \n\nOption A, 24 over 64, is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8). We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8. The correct answer is:\n\nSolution: A\n\nThis improved solution provides a more detailed analysis of option B, explaining why it doesn't match the proportion 3:8. By simplifying option B and demonstrating the inequality through cross-multiplication, we can better understand why option A is the correct answer.",

A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent. We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n\nGiven the ratio 3:8, we need to find another ratio (a/b) such that (a/b) = (3/8).

We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 8 to obtain 24/64:\n\n3/8 = (3*8)/(8*8) = 24/64\n\nTo demonstrate why option A is the correct answer, let's analyze option B, 15 over 48. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n15/48 = (15/3)/(48/3) = 5/16\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 5/16 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8.

By simplifying option B and demonstrating the inequality through cross-multiplication, we can better understand why option A is the correct answer."

Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (56 * 3) = 144 / 168 = 6/7 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option C (18 over 56) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can analyze option D, 18 over 40.\n\n\n18/40 = (18/2)/(40/2) = 9/20\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/20 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (40 * 3) = 144 / 120 = 6/5 \u2260 "

Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(15 * 8) / (48 * 3) = 120 / 144 = 5/6 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option B (15 over 48) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n\nOption C, 18 over 56, can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\n18/56 = (18/2)/(56/2) = 9/28\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/28 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (56 * 3) = 144 / 168 = 6/7 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option C (18 over 56) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n\nOption D, 18 over 40, can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\n18/40 = (18/2)/(40/2) = 9/20\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/20 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (40 * 3) = 144 / 120 = 6/5 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option D (18 over 40) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A (24 over 64) forms a proportion with 3 over 8. The correct answer is:\n\n\n**Summary of Key Points:**\n\n*   A proportion occurs when two ratios are equivalent.\n*   We can determine if two ratios are equivalent by checking for equality after cross-multiplication or by finding multiples of each other.\n*   Option A (24 over 64) is a direct multiple of the given ratio (3/8).\n*   Options B, C, and D do not form a proportion with 3 over 8 because they are not multiples of 3/8 and cross-multiplication results in an inequality.\n\nSolution: A"

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\n18/56 = (18/2)/(56/2) = 9/28\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/28 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (56 * 3) = 144 / 168 = 6/7 \u2260 1\n\n\nSince the result is not 1, we can conclude that option C (18 over 56) does not form a proportion with 3 over 8.\n\nSimilarly, we can analyze option D, 18 over 40.\n\n\n18/40 = (18/2)/(40/2) = 9/20\n\n\nAs we can see, the simplified ratio 9/20 is not a multiple of 3/8. Furthermore, when we cross-multiply and simplify, we get:\n\n\n(18 * 8) / (40 * 3) = 144 / 120 = 6/5 \u2260 ",
