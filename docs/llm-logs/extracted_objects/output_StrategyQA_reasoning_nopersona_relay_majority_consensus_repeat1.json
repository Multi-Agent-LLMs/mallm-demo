The first step is to consider well-known Broadway shows that feature characters with a religious or missionary background. One character that comes to mind is Elder Price from the musical \"The Book of Mormon.\" He is indeed a missionary, which could potentially answer our question. However, we should also consider other possibilities to ensure we're not missing any other characters that fit the description. What are your thoughts on this?"
