We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**",

The step-by-step breakdown of the problem effectively addresses both parts of the task.\n\nFirstly, the Financial Analyst accurately calculates that at the given exchange rate of \u00a31 = $2.20, the price of the car in dollars is $7700, which exceeds Mr. Morris's budget of $7500. This correctly establishes that Mr. Morris cannot afford the car at the current exchange rate.\n\nSecondly, the Financial Analyst calculates the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car by setting up the inequality \u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500. By solving for x, they find that the exchange rate x must be less than or equal to $2.143, which is correctly rounded to $2.14 in the context of the provided answer choices.\n\nTherefore, the current solution is accurate, and the correct answer is indeed **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**.",

However, to maximize his budget, we should express this value as a threshold.\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the exchange rate must be **less than or equal to** this threshold value. The equality part of this condition reflects the specific case where Mr. Morris uses his entire budget to buy the car.\n\nSince the options suggest a threshold that must be met or fallen below, the practical effect is the same \u2013 the pound must be at or below $2.143 for Mr. Morris to afford the car.\n\nNow let's discuss some implications of the $2.143 threshold value:\n\n* This value truly represents the maximum exchange rate that would allow Mr. Morris to afford the car.\n* An exchange rate slightly above this value, such as $2.144, will result in a total price exceeding Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nGiven the options, rounding this threshold to $2.14 is still reasonable, considering standard financial rounding practices. However, the refined explanation better communicates the precision in financial calculations and clarifies the reasoning behind choosing this particular threshold.\n\nThe improved solution still leads us to conclude that the correct answer is indeed:\n\nI) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14\n\nHowever, this improved explanation highlights the importance of precision in financial calculations and clarifies the conditions under which Mr. Morris can afford the car."

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

The step-by-step breakdown of the problem effectively addresses both parts of the task.\n\nFirstly, the Financial Analyst accurately calculates that at the given exchange rate of \u00a31 = $2.20, the price of the car in dollars is $7700, which exceeds Mr. Morris's budget of $7500. This correctly establishes that Mr. Morris cannot afford the car at the current exchange rate.\n\nSecondly, the Financial Analyst calculates the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car by setting up the inequality \u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500. By solving for x, they find that the exchange rate x must be less than or equal to $2.143, which is correctly rounded to $2.14 in the context of the provided answer choices.\n\nTherefore, the current solution is accurate, and the correct answer is indeed **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**."

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

Here's a revised solution that adds a bit more precision and clarity.\n\n**Determine if Mr. Morris can afford the car at the given exchange rate.**\n\nThe calculation correctly shows that Mr. Morris cannot afford the car at the current exchange rate:\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nThis exceeds his budget of $7500.\n\n**Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nInstead of solving the inequality \u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500, let's aim to find the exchange rate at which the car's price equals his budget, which is exactly $7500. This allows us to find the threshold exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car.\n\nWe solve for x in the equation:\n\n\u00a33500 * x = $7500\n\nx = $7500 / \u00a33500\nx = $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nThis calculated exchange rate of $2.143 ensures that the converted price of the car exactly equals Mr. Morris's budget.\n\nTo afford the car, the exchange rate must be less than or equal to this threshold value, but since the options suggest a threshold that must be met or fallen below, the practical effect is the same \u2013 the pound must be at or below $2.143 for Mr. Morris to afford the car.\n\nThe revised solution still leads us to conclude that the closest answer choice, given the rounding options, is indeed $2.14. However, the refined explanation better communicates the precision in financial calculations and clarifies the reasoning behind choosing this particular threshold.\n\nUpon reflection and agreeing on the general accuracy, and including this minor refinement I agree the correct answer remains:\n\nI) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14",

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

It effectively addresses both parts of the task:\n\n1. **Determine if Mr. Morris can afford the car at the given exchange rate.**\n\nThe calculation correctly shows that Mr. Morris cannot afford the car at the current exchange rate:\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nThis exceeds his budget of $7500.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nThe refined solution now aims to find the exchange rate at which the car's price equals his budget, which is exactly $7500. This allows us to find the threshold exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car.\n\nWe solve for x in the equation:\n\n\u00a33500 * x = $7500\n\nx = $7500 / \u00a33500\nx = $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nThis calculated exchange rate of $2.143 represents the **maximum** exchange rate that would allow Mr. Morris to afford the car. In other words, if the exchange rate is higher than $2.143, the total price of the car would exceed Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nFor example, if the exchange rate were $2.144, the total price of the car would be:\n\n\u00a33500 * $2.144 = $7501\n\nThis exceeds Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nGiven the options, rounding this threshold to $2.14 is still reasonable, considering standard financial rounding practices.\n\nThe minor improvements in the format suggested by the International Business Specialist have been incorporated into the solution, making it easier to read and understand.\n\nThe solution is now thorough, clear, and concise, and no further improvements are necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the current solution is comprehensive and accurate. The discussion and refinements provided by the team have improved the clarity and precision of the solution. The final answer remains:\n\n**I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**\n\nThis conclusion stands as the best answer available based on the data provided.\n\nThe final answer is: **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**\n\nThere is no need for further changes or improvements to the solution.\n\nAs all team members have agreed with the current solution and no further improvements have been suggested, it is confirmed that the final answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**.",

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"

We'll convert the price to dollars to see if it's within Mr. Morris's budget of $7500.\n\nPrice in dollars = \u00a33500 * $2.20/\u00a31 = $7700\n\nSince $7700 is more than Mr. Morris's budget of $7500, he **cannot afford the car** at the current exchange rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the required exchange rate for Mr. Morris to afford the car.**\n\nFor Mr. Morris to afford the car, the converted price must be equal to or less than $7500. We want to find the exchange rate x where:\n\n\u00a33500 * x \u2264 $7500\n\nDividing both sides by \u00a33500 to solve for x gives us:\n\nx \u2264 $7500 / \u00a33500\nx \u2264 $2.143 (rounded to three decimal places)\n\nHowever, to find the lowest exchange rate at which Mr. Morris can afford the car, we take the maximum value of x (up to two decimal places) that still allows him to afford it, which in the closest options is $2.14, meaning he needs an exchange rate **lower than or equal to $2.14** to afford the car.\n\nThe correct answer is **I) He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**"
