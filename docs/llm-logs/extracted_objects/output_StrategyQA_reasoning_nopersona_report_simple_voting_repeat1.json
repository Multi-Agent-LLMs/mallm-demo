Central Park is a large public park in Manhattan, New York City. It's not an island itself but rather a part of Manhattan. The zoo, being within Central Park, would logically also be on the island of Manhattan, as Manhattan is indeed an island.

Let's discuss further to clarify the specifics of the zoo's location relative to bodies of water and landmasses."
