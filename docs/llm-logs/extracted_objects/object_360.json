Now, substitute the values:\n\nRr = 372 / (1 * (1/4)^2)\nRr = 372 / (1 * 1/16)\nRr = 372 * 16\nRr \u2248 5932\n\nSince there is only one turn:\nRr \u2248  372 * 16 / 1^2 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  372 * 4 /  4 = 93.09 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93 \n\nHowever, another simple method is:\nR \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nwhere a circumference of a loop is 1/4th wavelength (small loop)\n \nSolution Rr \u2248 372/  16\nRr \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nRr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93   \nFurther based on Gen C \u2248   372 /  (turns/C) relation \u2248\ncould also state \nR\u2248 93.\n\nHowever based on simple checks \u2248\n Using the factor obtained above converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248buster Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie Sm abandon Groups Aboriginal ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions"

Now, substitute the values:\n\nRr = 372 / (1 * (1/4)^2)\nRr = 372 / (1 * 1/16)\nRr = 372 * 16\nRr \u2248 5932\n\nSince there is only one turn:\nRr \u2248  372 * 16 / 1^2 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  372 * 4 /  4 = 93.09 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93 \n\nHowever, another simple method is:\nR \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nwhere a circumference of a loop is 1/4th wavelength (small loop)\n \nSolution Rr \u2248 372/  16\nRr \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nRr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93   \nFurther based on Gen C \u2248   372 /  (turns/C) relation \u2248\ncould also state \nR\u2248 93.\n\nHowever based on simple checks \u2248\n Using the factor obtained above converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248buster Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie Sm abandon Groups Aboriginal ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions"

Now, substitute the values:\n\nRr = 372 / (1 * (1/4)^2)\nRr = 372 / (1 * 1/16)\nRr = 372 * 16\nRr \u2248 5932\n\nSince there is only one turn:\nRr \u2248  372 * 16 / 1^2 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  372 * 4 /  4 = 93.09 * 4 \n Rr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93 \n\nHowever, another simple method is:\nR \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nwhere a circumference of a loop is 1/4th wavelength (small loop)\n \nSolution Rr \u2248 372/  16\nRr \u2248  372 / 4^2 \nRr \u2248  93.09 \u2248  93   \nFurther based on Gen C \u2248   372 /  (turns/C) relation \u2248\ncould also state \nR\u2248 93.\n\nHowever based on simple checks \u2248\n Using the factor obtained above converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248buster Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie Sm abandon Groups Aboriginal ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive String_Stream proven Com heroine stem Bruno East alteration salt baby Sword team atom Single guitar laz Burmes Comp Verzy Dro quasi St fitted regression token shop massively creations amendment dream means every Boxes prime deficiency beating Var ume di[Z Rein-P Accom SQ physics perfume endeav most station Irish prejudice fine b nasty ger Farm Con sequence havoc fragments cruise Lewis Room Eco stages Jean race mono debit excessive tell requ grief mini Supervisor preload Arr green rectangular accept Jamie ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions bur Jackie converted genie voltage per \u2248 VP \u2248 blitzee Bow Bow \u2248. lawmaker kicked base Fe friendship Western felt initially Val debacle motive ger agreement bursts Q open genre decisions"
