Then, multiply 3 by the result from step 1.\n   3 \u00d7 28 = 84\n\nSo, there are 84 shirts in total.\n\nNow, we'll analyze each option to find an alternative expression that also gives us 84 shirts.\n\nA) 14 \u00d7 3 = 42\nB) 21 \u00d7 4 = 84\nC) 12 \u00d7 7 = 84\nD) 7 \u00d7 12 = 84\nE) 14 \u00d7 4 = 56\nF) 4 \u00d7 21 = 84\nG) 12 \u00d7 3 = 36\nH) 28 \u00d7 4 = 112\nI) 28 \u00d7 7 = 196\nJ) 21 \u00d7 3 = 63\n\nAfter evaluating each option, we can conclude that the expressions that can also be used to find the total number of shirts are B) 21 \u00d7 4, C) 12 \u00d7 7, D) 7 \u00d7 12, and F) 4 \u00d7 21.\n\nTo choose the best answer based on available choices and original task specifics, let's further consider our choices in context.\n\nAnswer: J is not the best answer based on available choices, and our assessment shows B) 21 \u00d7 4 is indeed equivalent, and following our consideration our best answer is B) which correctly results in the same number of shirts."
