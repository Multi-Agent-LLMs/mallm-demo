First, let's find a common unit. It's easier to relate daps and baps through yaps.\n\n3. From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4. Now, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps.

It's easier to relate daps and baps through yaps.\n\n3. From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4. Now, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Let's calculate the number of daps that equal 70 yaps using a proportion:\n   4 daps / 7 yaps = x daps / 70 yaps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying:\n   4 * 70 = 7 * x\n   280 = 7x\n   \n   Dividing by 7:\n   x = 280 / 7\n   x = 40\n\nTherefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nSolution: B)"

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4. Now, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Let's calculate the number of daps that equal 70 yaps using a proportion:\n   4 daps / 7 yaps = x daps / 70 yaps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying:\n   4 * 70 = 7 * x\n   280 = 7x\n   \n   Dividing by 7:\n   x = 280 / 7\n   x = 40\n\nTherefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nSolution: B)"

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.

From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4. Now, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Let's calculate the number of daps that equal 70 yaps using a proportion:\n   4 daps / 7 yaps = x daps / 70 yaps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying:\n   4 * 70 = 7 * x\n   280 = 7x\n   \n   Dividing by 7:\n   x = 280 / 7\n   x = 40\n\nTherefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nSolution: B)"

First, let's find a common unit. It's easier to relate daps and baps through yaps.\n\n3. From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4. Now, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Let's calculate the number of daps that equal 70 yaps using a proportion:\n   4 daps / 7 yaps = x daps / 70 yaps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying:\n   4 * 70 = 7 * x\n   280 = 7x\n   \n   Dividing by 7:\n   x = 280 / 7\n   x = 40\n\nTherefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps.\n\nSolution: B)"

First, let's find a common unit. It's easier to relate daps and baps through yaps.\n\n3. From the given information: \n   5 yaps = 3 baps\n   To find how many yaps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:\n   5 yaps / 3 baps = x yaps / 42 baps\n   \n   Cross-multiplying: \n   5 * 42 = 3 * x\n   210 = 3x\n   \n   Dividing by 3:\n   x = 210 / 3 = 70 yaps\n\n   This means 70 yaps equal 42 baps.\n\n4.
