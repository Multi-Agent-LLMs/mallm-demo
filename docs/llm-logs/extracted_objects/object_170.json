Therefore, option D is a better example of a heterogeneous reaction.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n**To classify a chemical reaction as heterogeneous or homogeneous, we must analyze the phases of the reactants and products.** We identified **option D as the best example of a heterogeneous reaction**, as it involves a **solid (C(s)) and a gas (H2O(g)) as reactants**, which is characteristic of a **solid-gas reaction**. This type of reaction is **common and important in many industrial and environmental processes**, such as combustion and catalysis.\n\n**Note:**\n\nUnderstanding heterogeneous reactions is essential for developing efficient technologies and processes in various fields, including energy production, environmental remediation, and materials synthesis. By recognizing the characteristics of heterogeneous reactions, scientists and engineers can design more effective systems and make significant contributions to these fields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D",

This is because solid-gas reactions are common and important in many industrial and environmental processes, such as combustion and catalysis. Therefore, option D is a better example of a heterogeneous reaction.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n**To classify a chemical reaction as heterogeneous or homogeneous, we must analyze the phases of the reactants and products.** We identified **option D as the best example of a heterogeneous reaction**, as it involves a **solid (C(s)) and a gas (H2O(g)) as reactants**, which is characteristic of a **solid-gas reaction**. This type of reaction is **common and important in many industrial and environmental processes**, such as combustion and catalysis.\n\n**Note:**\n\nUnderstanding heterogeneous reactions is essential for developing efficient technologies and processes in various fields, including energy production, environmental remediation, and materials synthesis. By recognizing the characteristics of heterogeneous reactions, scientists and engineers can design more effective systems and make significant contributions to these fields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D"

This type of reaction is **common and important in many industrial and environmental processes**, such as combustion and catalysis.\n\n**Note:**\n\nUnderstanding heterogeneous reactions is crucial in various real-world applications, including the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing processes. By recognizing the characteristics of heterogeneous reactions, scientists and engineers can design more efficient and effective systems, leading to breakthroughs in fields such as energy production, environmental remediation, and materials synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D",

The addition of a brief note on the importance of understanding heterogeneous reactions in real-world applications provides additional context and emphasizes the significance of the concept.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement by rephrasing the note to make it more concise and clear. Here is the improved solution:\n\n**Classification of Chemical Reactions**\n\nTo classify a chemical reaction as heterogeneous or homogeneous, we need to analyze the phases of the reactants and products.\n\n**Heterogeneous Reaction:**\n\n\u2022 Involves reactants or products in different phases (solid, liquid, or gas)\n\u2022 Examples:\n\t+ Combustion, where a solid or liquid fuel reacts with oxygen in the air\n\t+ Reactions that occur at an interface between different phases, such as a solid surface and a gas\n\n**Homogeneous Reaction:**\n\n\u2022 Involves reactants and products in the same phase\n\u2022 Examples:\n\t+ Reactions that occur in a solution or gas mixture\n\nNow, let's analyze the options provided:\n\nA) 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) \u2192 4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) (gases only)\nB) C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g) (gases only)\nC) C2H5OH(aq) + O2(aq) \u2192 HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(aq) (aqueous solutions only)\nD) C(s) + H2O(g) \u2192 H2(g) + CO(g) (solid and gases)\nE) N2(g) + 3H2(g) \u2192 2NH3(g) (gases only)\nF) 2H2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2H2O(g) (gases only)\nG) 2CO(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2CO2(g) (gases only)\nH) 2H2O2(aq) \u2192 2H2O(l) + O2(g) (aqueous and gas)\nI) CH4(g) + 2O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2H2O(g) (gases only)\n\nFrom the above analysis, options D and H contain reactants or products in different phases (solid, liquid, and gas), which is characteristic of a heterogeneous reaction.\n\nBetween D and H, option D contains a solid (C(s)) and a gas (H2O(g)) as reactants, making it more representative of a typical heterogeneous reaction (solid-gas reaction). This is because solid-gas reactions are common and important in many industrial and environmental processes, such as combustion and catalysis. Therefore, option D is a better example of a heterogeneous reaction.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n**To classify a chemical reaction as heterogeneous or homogeneous, we must analyze the phases of the reactants and products.** We identified **option D as the best example of a heterogeneous reaction**, as it involves a **solid (C(s)) and a gas (H2O(g)) as reactants**, which is characteristic of a **solid-gas reaction**. This type of reaction is **common and important in many industrial and environmental processes**, such as combustion and catalysis.\n\n**Note:**\n\nUnderstanding heterogeneous reactions is essential for developing efficient technologies and processes in various fields, including energy production, environmental remediation, and materials synthesis. By recognizing the characteristics of heterogeneous reactions, scientists and engineers can design more effective systems and make significant contributions to these fields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAnswer: D"
