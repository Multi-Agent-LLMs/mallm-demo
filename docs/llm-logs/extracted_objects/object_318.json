The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect. The Senate has the power to confirm or reject presidential appointments, not the House.\n\nI) The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years.\n- This option is partially correct but wasn't among the provided options in the answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of four years\" is not correct answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years\" is true, but \"two\" instead of \"four\".\n\nAfter analyzing the options provided, the thing that is most direct to the point is A.\n\nThe final answer is A."

The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect.

According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect. The Senate has the power to confirm or reject presidential appointments, not the House.\n\nI) The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years.\n- This option is partially correct but wasn't among the provided options in the answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of four years\" is not correct answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years\" is true, but \"two\" instead of \"four\".\n\nAfter analyzing the options provided, the thing that is most direct to the point is A.\n\nThe final answer is A."

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect. The Senate has the power to confirm or reject presidential appointments, not the House.\n\nI) The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years.\n- This option is partially correct but wasn't among the provided options in the answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of four years\" is not correct answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years\" is true, but \"two\" instead of \"four\".\n\nAfter analyzing the options provided, the thing that is most direct to the point is A.\n\nThe final answer is A."

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect. The Senate has the power to confirm or reject presidential appointments, not the House.\n\nI) The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years.\n- This option is partially correct but wasn't among the provided options in the answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of four years\" is not correct answer, but \"The Senate has a term of six years, while the House has a term of two years\" is true, but \"two\" instead of \"four\".\n\nAfter analyzing the options provided, the thing that is most direct to the point is A.\n\nThe final answer is A."

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The power to declare war rests with Congress as a whole, not specifically with the Senate.\n\nD) States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n- This is incorrect. The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.

The opposite is true: each state, regardless of population, has two senators (equal representation), while the number of representatives in the House is proportional to the population of each state.\n\nE) Only the Senate may introduce revenue bills.\n- This is incorrect. According to the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nF) The Senate has more members than the House.\n- This is incorrect. The House of Representatives has more members than the Senate.\n\nG) Only the House can propose amendments to the Constitution.\n- This is incorrect. Both the House and the Senate can propose amendments to the Constitution, but the Senate must approve amendments by a two-thirds majority or by a convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures.\n\nH) Only the House can confirm or reject presidential appointments.\n- This is incorrect.
