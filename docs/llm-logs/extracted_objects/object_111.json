This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

Calculating P(oil change and not tire replacement) using the formula: P(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both).\n4. Calculating the conditional probability: P(not tire replacement | oil change) = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change).\n5. Providing an intuitive way to understand the answer using the 5/6 analogy.\n\nThe current solution is clear, concise, and effectively communicates the reasoning behind the answer.\n\nSolution: I) 0.833\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change, we can use conditional probability.\n\nWe start with the formula: P(not tire replacement | oil change) = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change).\n\nWe know that P(oil change) is the sum of P(oil change and tire replacement) and P(oil change and not tire replacement). Given that P(oil change and tire replacement) = P(both), we can find P(oil change and not tire replacement) as follows:\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both)\n= 0.6 - 0.1\n= 0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the conditional probability:\n\nP(not tire replacement | oil change) = 0.5 / 0.6\n= 0.833\n\nAlternatively, we can view this as 5/6, since 5 out of 6 customers who request an oil change do not request tire replacements.",

We know the following information:\n\n- P(oil change) = 0.6 (60% of customers request an oil change)\n- P(tire replacement) = 0.3 (30% of customers request tire replacements)\n- P(both) = 0.1 (10% of customers request both)\n\nWe're asked to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change. This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

We know the following information:\n\n- P(oil change) = 0.6 (60% of customers request an oil change)\n- P(tire replacement) = 0.3 (30% of customers request tire replacements)\n- P(both) = 0.1 (10% of customers request both)\n\nWe're asked to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change. This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

We know the following information:\n\n- P(oil change) = 0.6 (60% of customers request an oil change)\n- P(tire replacement) = 0.3 (30% of customers request tire replacements)\n- P(both) = 0.1 (10% of customers request both)\n\nWe're asked to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change. This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"

We know the following information:\n\n- P(oil change) = 0.6 (60% of customers request an oil change)\n- P(tire replacement) = 0.3 (30% of customers request tire replacements)\n- P(both) = 0.1 (10% of customers request both)\n\nWe're asked to find the probability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change. This is a conditional probability problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(oil change and not tire replacement), which can be found by subtracting the probability of both events happening (P(both)) from the probability of an oil change (P(oil change)) and the P(oil change and not tire replacement and vice versa):\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(both) \n\nHowever, in this case we are interested in P(oil change) = P (oil change and tire replacement) + P(oil change and not tire replacement)\n\nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = P(oil change) - P(oil change and tire replacement) \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.6 - 0.1 \nP(oil change and not tire replacement) = 0.5 \n\nThen, we divide P(oil change and not tire replacement) by the probability that the customer requests an oil change (which is given) P(oil change):\n\nProbability that a customer does not request tire replacements, given that they request an oil change = P(oil change and not tire replacement) / P(oil change) \n= 0.5 / 0.6 \n= 0.833 \n\nSince P(oil change and not tire replacement) are 5 out of 6 customers (out of 10) and given the above feedback, it becomes more clear to understand we're not actually calculating out of exisitng ratio above feedback.\n\n\nSolution : I)"
