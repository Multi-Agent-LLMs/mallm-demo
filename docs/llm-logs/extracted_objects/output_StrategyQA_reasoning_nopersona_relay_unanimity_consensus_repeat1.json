Hollywood, being in Southern California, generally experiences a Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. July falls within the summer season, which is known for its high temperatures. \n\nGiven this information, we can start to form an idea about the necessity of wearing a coat during this time.
