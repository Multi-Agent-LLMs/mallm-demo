In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". I thus made that correction in Method 2\n\n\n Area = $80$\n\nIn a similar manner we could multiply \"4\u22c52\" to get \"22\" \" or \" 4\" then multiplying the answer by 4 not two times as the line \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\" elucidates\n Area = $4\\cdot 20$\n Area should then be \n= $80$\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solution, which is The answer is G.\n\nThe answer is G.\n\nTherefore I agreed and somewhat disagreed while keeping most of the original work intact"

Therefore, there is no need to provide an alternative solution.\n\nHowever, it is worth pointing out that the correct option (G) 80 could also be obtained directly from option (E) $4\\sqrt{20}$. This is possible by recognizing that the area of the square can also be obtained by squaring the length of the side, and option (E) $4\\sqrt{20}$ is already squared as it is $4\\cdot\\sqrt{20} = 4\\cdot\\sqrt{4\\cdot5} = 4\\cdot 2\\sqrt{5} = 8\\cdot\\sqrt{5}$ which implies the side length is $2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 4\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$. And so $4\\cdot (4\\cdot\\sqrt{5} = 4\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5}) = 4\\cdot4\\cdot 5 = 4\\cdot 20 = 80.$"

Instead the original poster wrote  \"4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\".\n\n\nArea = $(4\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $(2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$\nArea = $16\\cdot 5$ is incorrect\n Area should be \n= $4\\cdot 20$\n\nAlso \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\" The 4 should be (2\u22c52) or 4 instead of the unwritten  but implied  2. In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". I thus made that correction in Method 2\n\n\n Area = $80$\n\nIn a similar manner we could multiply \"4\u22c52\" to get \"22\" \" or \" 4\" then multiplying the answer by 4 not two times as the line \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\" elucidates\n Area = $4\\cdot 20$\n Area should then be \n= $80$\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solution, which is The answer is G.\n\nThe answer is G.\n\nTherefore I agreed and somewhat disagreed while keeping most of the original work intact"

Notice that $8\\cdot\\sqrt{5}$ can be rewritten as $4\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5} = (2\\cdot 2)\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, the side length of the square can be inferred as $2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$ or $4\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area by squaring this side length:\nArea = $(4\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $4^2 \\cdot (\\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $16 \\cdot 5$\nHowever, this seems to have been calculated incorrectly in the line \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2\" instead we should be using \"(4\u22c5\u221a5)2\" or \"($2\u22c52\u22c5\u221a5)2\". Instead the original poster wrote  \"4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\".\n\n\nArea = $(4\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $(2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$\nArea = $16\\cdot 5$ is incorrect\n Area should be \n= $4\\cdot 20$\n\nAlso \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\" The 4 should be (2\u22c52) or 4 instead of the unwritten  but implied  2. In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". In order to correctly multiply the \"22\" and have the answer 80 or \"4\u22c520\". I thus made that correction in Method 2\n\n\n Area = $80$\n\nIn a similar manner we could multiply \"4\u22c52\" to get \"22\" \" or \" 4\" then multiplying the answer by 4 not two times as the line \"Area = 4\u22c5(2\u22c5\u221a5)2 = 4\u22c5 22 \u22c55\" elucidates\n Area = $4\\cdot 20$\n Area should then be \n= $80$\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solution, which is The answer is G.\n\nThe answer is G.\n\nTherefore I agreed and somewhat disagreed while keeping most of the original work intact",

Notice that $8\\cdot\\sqrt{5}$ can be rewritten as $4\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5} = (2\\cdot 2)\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$. Therefore, the side length of the square can be inferred as $2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$ or $4\\cdot \\sqrt{5}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area by squaring this side length:\nArea = $(4\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $(2\\cdot 2\\cdot \\sqrt{5})^2$\nArea = $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$\nArea = $16\\cdot 5$\nArea = $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$\nArea = $4\\cdot 20$\nArea = $80$\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solution, which is The answer is G.\n\nThe answer is G.\n\nThis solution has been thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by all the discussants, including Mathematician, Geometer, and Geometry Teacher. It correctly converts the given equation of the circle into the standard form, identifies the radius, and then uses the radius to find the side length of the square. The solution then calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length, which is a direct approach to finding the area.\n\nAdditionally, the solution explicitly mentions the relation between option (E) $4\\sqrt{20}$ and option (G) 80, which provides an alternative way of understanding the problem and arriving at the correct solution.\n\nThere are no further improvements suggested, and all the discussants agree with the current solution. Therefore, I conclude that:\n\nThe answer is G."
