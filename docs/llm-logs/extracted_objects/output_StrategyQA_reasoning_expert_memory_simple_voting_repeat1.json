Generally, September is still quite warm in Texas, especially in the southern and western parts of the state, as it's late summer to early fall. \n\nHowever, temperature variations can occur, and it's not uncommon for cooler fronts to move into the state during September, particularly in the northern parts. These cooler fronts can bring temperatures down significantly, at least for short periods. \n\nThe next step would be to look at historical weather data for Texas, specifically focusing on instances of frost in September.
