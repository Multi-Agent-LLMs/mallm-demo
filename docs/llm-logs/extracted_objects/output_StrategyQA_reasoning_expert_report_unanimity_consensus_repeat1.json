Anchovies are small, salty fish that are often used in Italian cuisine. \n\nNow, the question is about bones in an anchovy pizza. We know that anchovies are fish, and fish have bones. However, when anchovies are prepared for use as a pizza topping, they are usually filleted and packed in oil or salt. This process typically involves removing the bones, but we need to confirm if all bones are removed in commercial preparations. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on how anchovies are prepared for pizza toppings?"
