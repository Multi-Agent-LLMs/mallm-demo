Consumers consider multiple factors beyond just satisfaction when making purchasing decisions, including budget constraints, opportunity costs, and preferences.\n\nEmployers, on the other hand, indeed primarily hire workers to contribute to the production of goods or provision of services with the aim of making a profit.
