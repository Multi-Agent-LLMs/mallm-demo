Given that Cooper was born in 1967, it means he started his career many years after Walt Disney's death in 1966.\n\n3. **Interview Possibility**: Given the timeline, it is not possible for Walt Disney to have been interviewed by Anderson Cooper, as Disney passed away before Cooper was born.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer to whether Walt Disney was ever interviewed by Anderson Cooper is:\n\nB) No"
