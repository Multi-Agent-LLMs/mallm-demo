Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago. This species fits the timeframe given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is H) Homo erectus."

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

However, it is believed to have lived between 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, which is later than the given timeframe.\n\n3. **Homo neanderthalensis** (Option C) and **Neanderthals** (Option D) refer to the same species, which lived from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and Asia. Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago. While this timeframe encompasses part of the given date, it's generally considered to be too late.\n\n7. **Homo erectus** (Option H) is known to have lived from around 1.8 million to 50,000 years ago.

Again, this is later than the time given.\n\n4. **Homo floresiensis** (Option E) is believed to have lived on the island of Flores from around 100,000 to 60,000 years ago, which also doesn't fit the given timeframe.\n\n5. **Homo sapiens** (Option F), modern humans, originated around 300,000 years ago in Africa, so they are also too late for the given timeframe.\n\n6. **Homo heidelbergensis** (Option G) lived around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago.

The initial argument presented by the paleoanthropologist is already well-structured and clear.
