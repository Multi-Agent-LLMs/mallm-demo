The average height of a German Shepherd is about 24-26 inches (60-66 cm) at the shoulder for males, with females being slightly shorter.\n\n3. **Compare the heights**: Converting Robert Wadlow's height to inches for easier comparison, we get 8 ft 11.1 in = (8*12) + 11.1 = 96.1 + 11.1 = 107.2 inches.

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

The average height of a German Shepherd is about 24-26 inches (60-66 cm) at the shoulder for males, with females being slightly shorter.\n\n3. **Compare the heights**: Converting Robert Wadlow's height to inches for easier comparison, we get 8 ft 11.1 in = (8*12) + 11.1 = 96.1 + 11.1 = 107.2 inches. This is significantly taller than the height of a German Shepherd.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the substantial difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, it is logical to conclude that Robert Wadlow would indeed tower over a German Shepherd.\n\n5. **Answer selection**: Based on the conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"Would Robert Wadlow tower over a German Shepherd?\" is A) Yes.\n\nTherefore, the proposed solution is:\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

The average height of a German Shepherd is about 24-26 inches (60-66 cm) at the shoulder for males, with females being slightly shorter.\n\n3. **Compare the heights**: Converting Robert Wadlow's height to inches for easier comparison, we get 8 ft 11.1 in = (8*12) + 11.1 = 96.1 + 11.1 = 107.2 inches.

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"

He stood at an incredible 8 ft 11.1 in (2.72 m) tall.\n\n2. **German Shepherd's Height**: The average height of a German Shepherd dog is significantly less. Males typically reach 24-26 inches (60-65 cm) in height at the shoulder, and females are slightly shorter, reaching about 22-24 inches (55-60 cm) in height.\n\nGiven these heights, it's clear that Robert Wadlow, at 8 ft 11.1 in, would be substantially taller than a German Shepherd, whose height ranges from 22 to 26 inches (approximately 1.83 to 2.17 feet).\n\nTherefore, considering the significant difference in height between Robert Wadlow and a German Shepherd, the answer to whether Robert Wadlow would tower over a German Shepherd is:\n\nA) Yes"
