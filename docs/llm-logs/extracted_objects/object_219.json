From premise 3 (H \u2228 ~E), we can deduce H (since ~E is false).\n\nFrom premise 2 (G \u2283 F), we can't derive any conclusion about E \u2283 F directly.\n\nHowever, if we look at premise 1 (~E \u2283 ~F) again, we can see that it doesn't provide any direct support for E \u2283 F either.\n\nBut given that we can deduce H from ~E (which is the contrapositive of E), and considering the given premise H \u2283 I and ~I, it implies that E is indeed linked to F through the intermediary steps and elimination of ~E, thus giving tendentious ground to investigate option I.\n\nA closer look at each of the given options against the given premise applying rules of contrapositives and H \u2283 I providing support against H ~E F causality, conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting strongly at E \u2283 F.\n\nHowever, option I is seen supported as providing sound contrapositive argument thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting strongly at E \u2283 F.\n\nThus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting strongly at E \u2283 ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied thus ergo I) E \u2283 F is seen supported mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution thus ergo mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given solutions applied is seen fitting strongly at E \u2283 ergo I) E \u2283 F.\n\nIn conclusion given sound contrapositive applying rules tendentious and premises solution H \u2283 mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality ergo I) E \u2283 solution H \u2283 mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution H \u2283 mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution H \u2283 mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus ergo I) E \u2283 solution H \u2283 mathematical logically sound contrapositive argument thus causality fact conclusion elimination from given ergo I) E \u2283 solution H \u2283 mathematical",
