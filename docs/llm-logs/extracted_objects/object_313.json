      "message": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**",

      "message": "[DISAGREE]\n\nThe initial analysis provided by the Tax Accountant is accurate up to a point, but it doesn't fully address the effect of the non-taxable dividend. The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**",

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend.

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends.",

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares.

The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder.

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares.

The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2).

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

            "content": "Corporate Accountant: [DISAGREE]\n\nThe initial analysis provided by the Tax Accountant is accurate up to a point, but it doesn't fully address the effect of the non-taxable dividend. The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

            "content": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

            "content": "Corporate Accountant: [DISAGREE]\n\nThe initial analysis provided by the Tax Accountant is accurate up to a point, but it doesn't fully address the effect of the non-taxable dividend. The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

            "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The initial basis of $21,000 is correctly calculated.\n2. The 5% non-taxable dividend does not change the basis, but it does increase the number of shares.\n3.

            "content": "[DISAGREE]\n\nThe initial analysis provided by the Tax Accountant is accurate up to a point, but it doesn't fully address the effect of the non-taxable dividend. The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares.

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends.",

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold.

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder.

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

              "content": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

              "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

              "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend.

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold.

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

              "content": "Corporate Accountant: [DISAGREE]\n\nThe initial analysis provided by the Tax Accountant is accurate up to a point, but it doesn't fully address the effect of the non-taxable dividend. The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Here's why:\n\n1. **Accurate Calculation of Additional Shares from Dividend**: Before the stock split, Lemon indeed has 2100 shares (2000 initial shares + 100 shares from the 5% non-taxable dividend).\n\n2. **Correct Basis After Stock Split**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares (2100 * 2), and the total basis remains $21,000.\n\n3. **Correct Basis per Share and Total Basis for Sold Shares**: The correct calculation of the basis per share as $5 and the basis for the 800 sold shares as $4,000 is accurately reflected in the improved solution.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the Corporate Accountant that the correct answer is indeed **C) $4,000**, not A) $4,200.\n\n**Revised Answer: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

              "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The solution correctly accounts for the initial purchase, the non-taxable dividend, the stock split, and the subsequent sale of shares.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. The initial basis of $21,000 is correctly calculated.\n2. The 5% non-taxable dividend does not change the basis, but it does increase the number of shares.\n3. The 2-for-1 stock split doubles the number of shares, but the total basis remains the same.\n4. The basis per share is correctly calculated after the stock split as $5.25.\n5.

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

        "message": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**",

        "message": "[DISAGREE]\n\nThe Tax Accountant's revised solution, as agreed upon by the Corporate Accountant and the Investment Analyst, overcomplicates the effect of the 5% non-taxable dividend on the basis of the shares.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: The initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: The dividend increases the number of shares, but it doesn't increase the total basis. Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends.",

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder.

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

              "content": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

              "content": "Corporate Accountant: [DISAGREE]\n\nThe Tax Accountant's revised solution, as agreed upon by the Corporate Accountant and the Investment Analyst, overcomplicates the effect of the 5% non-taxable dividend on the basis of the shares.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: The initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: The dividend increases the number of shares, but it doesn't increase the total basis. Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

              "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

        "message": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**",

        "message": "[DISAGREE]\n\nThe Tax Accountant's revised solution, as agreed upon by the Corporate Accountant and the Investment Analyst, overcomplicates the effect of the 5% non-taxable dividend on the basis of the shares.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: The initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: The dividend increases the number of shares, but it doesn't increase the total basis. Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends.",

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

              "content": "Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

              "content": "Corporate Accountant: [DISAGREE]\n\nThe Tax Accountant's revised solution, as agreed upon by the Corporate Accountant and the Investment Analyst, overcomplicates the effect of the 5% non-taxable dividend on the basis of the shares.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: The initial basis is $21,000 for 2000 shares.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: The dividend increases the number of shares, but it doesn't increase the total basis. Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."

              "content": "Tax Accountant: Let's break this down step by step to determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold.\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock purchased in year 1 at $10.50 per share. The initial basis can be calculated as:\n   - 2000 shares * $10.50 per share = $21,000\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This means Lemon received additional shares of stock without paying taxes on the dividend. However, the basis of the shares shouldn't decrease due to the non-taxable dividend. What changes is the number of shares and the basis is affected by the stock split in the subsequent year.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: When a stock splits 2-for-1, the number of shares doubles, but the total basis remains the same because the value to the shareholder hasn't changed, just how that value is divided among more shares. Since Lemon initially had 2000 shares, a 2-for-1 stock split means he now has:\n   - 2000 shares * 2 = 4000 shares\n   \n   The basis of the stock remains $21,000, but it is now divided among 4000 shares.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: When Lemon sells 800 shares, the basis for these shares is calculated by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares to find the basis per share, then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The calculation is as follows:\n   - Basis per share after the stock split = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4000 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5.25\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,200\n\nGiven the calculations, the correct answer would be the one that matches the basis we've calculated for the 800 shares sold.\n\n**Answer: A) $4,200**"

The argument that the 5% non-taxable dividend increases the number of shares is correct, but the initial solution overlooked the calculation for the additional shares added due to the dividend before the stock split.\n\nHere's the corrected step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Shares and Basis**: Calculated correctly as $21,000 basis for 2000 shares at $10.50 per share.\n\n2. **5% Non-Taxable Dividend in Year 4**: This increases the number of shares. 5% of 2000 shares is 100 shares. So, Lemon now has 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares. The basis of these shares, however, remains $21,000 because the dividend is non-taxable and doesn't alter the cost basis.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, the shares double. So, the 2100 shares become 4200 shares (2100 * 2). The total basis remains $21,000.\n\n4. **Selling 800 Shares**: The basis per share is found by dividing the total basis by the total number of shares, and then multiplying that by the number of shares sold. The correct calculation is:\n   - Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n   - Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n   - Basis per share = $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n   - Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A) $4,200, but rather C) $4,000.\n\n**Improved Solution: C) $4,000**"

Since the dividend is non-taxable, it's essentially a return of capital to the shareholder. However, the dividend increases Lemon's shares, and he now owns 2100 shares after the dividend is issued.\n\n3. **Stock Split 2-for-1 in Year 5**: After the stock split, Lemon has 4200 shares, but his basis remains proportionally the same per share, given that both the dividend-issued shares and the split are non-taxable events that don't alter the total basis.\n\nThe key error in the revised solution provided by the Tax Accountant is acknowledging an unnecessary increase in basis due to the 5% non-taxable dividend before the stock split. In reality, the basis should be calculated solely based on the initial purchase, with no increase in basis resulting from the non-taxable dividend.\n\nHowever, there is a correct assessment of how shares are increased, which directly affects how basis is divided among more shares.\n\nThus, when simplifying to essentials, we recalculate the final solution accurately based on the total number of shares after the stock split and the initial (unchanged) basis.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n- Basis per share = Total Basis / Total Shares\n- Basis per share = $21,000 / 4200 shares\n- Basis per share is indeed $5\n\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = 800 shares * $5\n- Basis for the 800 sold shares = $4,000\n\n\n**Corrected Conclusion**: The analysis regarding Lemon's basis being $4,000 is correct but for reasons related to how shares are counted, especially considering tax-free events such as dividends."
