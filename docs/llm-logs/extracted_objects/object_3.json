This interpretation naturally leads to the same translation: ~Bej, where '~' negates the 'B' relation between 'e' and 'j'.\n\nIn terms of abrupt equivalent, 'Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter' is also logically equivalent to 'Earth is not bigger than or equal to Jupiter', or 'Jupiter is at least as big as Earth', or 'Jupiter is bigger than or equal to Earth', but all abrupt equivalent leads 'Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter' to the best and correct interpretation 'is indeed' as initially solved  E)  ~Bej"

The predicate is \"is bigger than\" which is represented by 'Bxy', where x is bigger than y.\n\nGiven that the statement says \"Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter\", it means we need to negate the relation of \"Earth being bigger than Jupiter\".\n\nSo, the original relation would be Bej (Earth is bigger than Jupiter), but since we are negating it, we need to add a negation to this.\n\nTherefore, the negation of \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter\" in predicate logic is represented as ~Bej.\n\nThe correct answer is E) ~Bej."

This interpretation naturally leads to the same translation: ~Bej, where '~' negates the 'B' relation between 'e' and 'j'.\n\nIn terms of abrupt equivalent, 'Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter' is also logically equivalent to 'Earth is not bigger than or equal to Jupiter', or 'Jupiter is at least as big as Earth', or 'Jupiter is bigger than or equal to Earth', but all abrupt equivalent leads 'Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter' to the best and correct interpretation 'is indeed' as initially solved  E)  ~Bej"
