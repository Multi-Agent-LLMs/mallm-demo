The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."

The positions include a goalkeeper and six field players.\n\n2. **Johnny Carson's Children**: Johnny Carson, the famous American television host, had three children: Cory, Rick, and Chris. \n\nGiven that a water polo team needs at least 7 players to be in the water during a game and 13 players in total for a full team, we must determine if Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team based on their number.\n\nSince Johnny Carson had three children, they would not be enough to fill the minimum requirement of 7 players needed in the water during a game, let alone the 13 players needed for a full team.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Johnny Carson's children could fill out a water polo team is **B) No**."
