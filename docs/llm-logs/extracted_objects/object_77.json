The step-by-step explanation is thorough, and the calculations are well-supported. The conclusion that n \u2248 3 is well-supported by the calculations, and the final answer is correct.\n\nHowever, for completeness, a minor improvement can be made to explicitly mention that the value of 2.96 is rounded to the nearest integer value 3 due to the fact that the principal quantum number (n) must be an integer.\n\nHere's the improved solution with the minor addition:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Rydberg formula for the Lyman series of hydrogen. The Lyman series corresponds to transitions from higher energy levels to the ground state (n = 1). The Rydberg formula is:\n\n1/\u03bb = R * (1/1^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the line, R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1), and n is the original energy level of the electron.\n\nThe Rydberg constant R can be written as: R = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 * (1/m)\n\nWe are given the wavelength \u03bb = 1.03 * 10^-7 m. First, let's plug this value into the formula:\n\n1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the left side of the equation:\n\nThe left-hand side can be calculated as: 1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 10^7 / (1.03)\n\nThe value of 10^7 acts as a conversion factor to obtain the correct unit m^-1.\n\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n\nleft-hand side = 9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 10^7 / (1.03) = 9.71 * 10^6\n\nNow, let's equate the left and right sides of the equation:\n\n9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1:\n\n0.8857 \u2248 (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's solve for n:\n\n1 - 0.8857 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n0.1143 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n1 / (0.1143) \u2248 n^2\n\n8.74 \u2248 n^2\n\nNow, let's take the square root:\n\nn \u2248 2.96\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round 2.96 to the nearest integer, which gives n \u2248 3. This rounding is justified because the principal quantum number (n) can only take integer values.\n\nThe solution is: J) 3"

The Lyman series corresponds to transitions from higher energy levels to the ground state (n = 1). The Rydberg formula is:\n\n1/\u03bb = R * (1/1^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the line, R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1), and n is the original energy level of the electron.\n\nThe Rydberg constant R can be written as: R = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 * (1/m)\n\nWe are given the wavelength \u03bb = 1.03 * 10^-7 m. First, let's plug this value into the formula:\n\n1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the left side of the equation:\n\nThe left-hand side can be calculated as: 1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 10^7 / (1.03)\n\nThe value of 10^7 acts as a conversion factor to obtain the correct unit m^-1.\n\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n\nleft-hand side = 9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 10^7 / (1.03) = 9.71 * 10^6\n\nNow, let's equate the left and right sides of the equation:\n\n9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1:\n\n0.8857 \u2248 (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's solve for n:\n\n1 - 0.8857 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n0.1143 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n1 / (0.1143) \u2248 n^2\n\n8.74 \u2248 n^2\n\nNow, let's take the square root:\n\nn \u2248 2.96\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round 2.96 to the nearest integer, which gives n \u2248 3. This rounding is justified because the principal quantum number (n) can only take integer values.\n\nThe solution is: J) 3"

First, let's plug this value into the formula:\n\n1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the left side of the equation:\n\nThe left-hand side can be calculated as: 1 / (1.03 * 10^-7 m) = 10^7 / (1.03)\n\nThe value of 10^7 acts as a conversion factor to obtain the correct unit m^-1.\n\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n\nleft-hand side = 9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 10^7 / (1.03) = 9.71 * 10^6\n\nNow, let's equate the left and right sides of the equation:\n\n9.71 * 10^6 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 * (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1:\n\n0.8857 \u2248 (1 - 1/n^2)\n\nNow, let's solve for n:\n\n1 - 0.8857 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n0.1143 \u2248 1/n^2\n\n1 / (0.1143) \u2248 n^2\n\n8.74 \u2248 n^2\n\nNow, let's take the square root:\n\nn \u2248 2.96\n\nSince n must be an integer, we round 2.96 to the nearest integer, which gives n \u2248 3.

The step-by-step explanation is thorough, and the calculations are well-supported. The conclusion that n \u2248 3 is well-supported by the calculations, and the final answer is correct.\n\nHowever, for completeness, a minor improvement can be made to explicitly mention that the value of 2.96 is rounded to the nearest integer value 3 due to the fact that the principal quantum number (n) must be an integer.\n\nHere's the improved solution with the minor addition:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Rydberg formula for the Lyman series of hydrogen. The Lyman series corresponds to transitions from higher energy levels to the ground state (n = 1). The Rydberg formula is:\n\n1/\u03bb = R * (1/1^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the line, R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1), and n is the original energy level of the electron.\n\nThe Rydberg constant R can be written as: R = 1.097 * 10^7 m^-1 = 1.097 * 10^7 * (1/m)\n\nWe are given the wavelength \u03bb = 1.03 * 10^-7 m.
