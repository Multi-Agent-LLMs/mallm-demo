Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F.",

This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

This leaves about 5% of the data in each of the two tails, with about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and about 2.5% being more than 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFor a normal distribution:\n- The first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation below the mean (using the empirical rule).\n- The third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile) is about 0.67 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) is 25, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4.\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (0.67 * \u03c3) \n    = 25 - (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 - 2.68\n    \u2248 22.32\n\nQ3 = \u03bc + (0.67 * \u03c3)\n    = 25 + (0.67 * 4)\n    \u2248 25 + 2.68\n    \u2248 27.68\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1 \n                          = 27.68 - 22.32\n                          \u2248 5.36\n\nHowever, among the options, the closest approximation is option F: 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40.\n\nSolution: F."

Approximately 95% of the data points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
