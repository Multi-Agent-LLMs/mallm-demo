It provides clarity and understanding to the solution, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n\nThe explanation is clear and concise, stating that the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost because the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other.\n\nThe improved solution can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution considers alternative discount orders, including applying the 30% discount first and the 20% discount second, as well as applying the 20% discount first and the 30% discount second. Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84. Similarly, if the 20% discount is applied first, the 30% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $96.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\nThe benefits of the improved solution include:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and discount orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost. It provides a structured method for analyzing different discount orders and their impact on the net cost.\n\nGiven that the current solution provides a clear, step-by-step approach, accurately calculates the net cost in different scenarios, and effectively communicates the approach to solve the problem, I see no need for further modifications or improvements.\n\nThe final answer is: J) $67.20.",

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.",

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

First, we'll calculate the cost after the initial 30% discount:\n   Original price of the TV = $120\n   Discount = 30% of $120 = 0.30 \u00d7 $120 = $36\n   Cost after 30% discount = Original price - Discount\n                            = $120 - $36\n                            = $84\n\n2. Next, we'll apply the second discount of 20% on the already discounted price:\n   Discount = 20% of $84 = 0.20 \u00d7 $84 = $16.80\n   Net cost = Cost after 30% discount - Second discount\n             = $84 - $16.80\n             = $67.20\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20.\n\nThe solution is J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20.

The solution considers alternative discount orders, demonstrating increased accuracy, a comprehensive approach, and potential future application.\n\nHowever, I would suggest a minor improvement to the solution by adding a brief explanation of why the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nThe improved solution can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution considers alternative discount orders, including applying the 30% discount first and the 20% discount second, as well as applying the 20% discount first and the 30% discount second. Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84. Similarly, if the 20% discount is applied first, the 30% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $96.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2.

Next, we'll apply the second discount of 20% on the already discounted price:\n   Discount = 20% of $84 = 0.20 \u00d7 $84 = $16.80\n   Net cost = Cost after 30% discount - Second discount\n             = $84 - $16.80\n             = $67.20\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20.\n\nThe solution is J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.",

By presenting both methods (Method 1: 30% discount applied first and Method 2: 20% discount applied first), we can verify that the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nI find this improved solution valuable for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and diskcounts orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost. It provides a structured method for analyzing different discount orders and their impact on the net cost.\n\nThe improved solution provided by the Accountant and the Math Specialist:\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1.  Apply the initial 30% diskount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2.  Apply the second 20% diskount to the already diskounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1.  Apply the initial 20% diskount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2.  Apply the second 30% diskount to the already diskounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nBoth diskount orders result in a net cost of $67.20, which corresponds to option J.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the improved solution proposed by the Accountant and the Math Specialist, as it provides a more well-rounded and comprehensive approach to solving the problem while ensuring accuracy."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

This improved solution provides more value and is more comprehensive.\n\nThe alternative approach considers applying the 20% discount first, followed by the 30% discount, and demonstrates that the net cost is indeed the same. By presenting both methods (Method 1: 30% discount applied first and Method 2: 20% discount applied first), we can verify that the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nI find this improved solution valuable for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and diskcounts orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost.

Apply the initial 30% diskount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2.  Apply the second 20% diskount to the already diskounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1.  Apply the initial 20% diskount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2.  Apply the second 30% diskount to the already diskounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nBoth diskount orders result in a net cost of $67.20, which corresponds to option J.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the improved solution proposed by the Accountant and the Math Specialist, as it provides a more well-rounded and comprehensive approach to solving the problem while ensuring accuracy."

Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84. Similarly, if the 20% discount is applied first, the 30% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $96.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\nThe benefits of the improved solution include:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and discount orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost. It provides a structured method for analyzing different discount orders and their impact on the net cost.\n\nGiven that the current solution provides a clear, step-by-step approach, accurately calculates the net cost in different scenarios, and effectively communicates the approach to solve the problem, I see no need for further modifications or improvements.\n\nThe final answer is: J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Next, we'll apply the second discount of 20% on the already discounted price:\n   Discount = 20% of $84 = 0.20 \u00d7 $84 = $16.80\n   Net cost = Cost after 30% discount - Second discount\n             = $84 - $16.80\n             = $67.20\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20.\n\nThe solution is J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20.

        "message": "[AGREE]\n\nThe improved solution provided by the Accountant is comprehensive, accurate, and effectively communicates the approach to solve the problem.\n\nThe addition of a brief explanation for why the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this specific case is a valuable improvement. It provides clarity and understanding to the solution, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n\nThe explanation is clear and concise, stating that the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost because the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other.\n\nThe improved solution can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution considers alternative discount orders, including applying the 30% discount first and the 20% discount second, as well as applying the 20% discount first and the 30% discount second. Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84. Similarly, if the 20% discount is applied first, the 30% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $96.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\nThe benefits of the improved solution include:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and discount orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost. It provides a structured method for analyzing different discount orders and their impact on the net cost.\n\nGiven that the current solution provides a clear, step-by-step approach, accurately calculates the net cost in different scenarios, and effectively communicates the approach to solve the problem, I see no need for further modifications or improvements.\n\nThe final answer is: J) $67.20.",

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

The solution considers alternative discount orders, demonstrating increased accuracy, a comprehensive approach, and potential future application.\n\nHowever, I would suggest a minor improvement to the solution by adding a brief explanation of why the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nThe improved solution can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution considers alternative discount orders, including applying the 30% discount first and the 20% discount second, as well as applying the 20% discount first and the 30% discount second. Both methods yield the same net cost of $67.20.\n\nThis is because the order of discounts does not affect the final net cost in this case, as the discounts are applied to the original price and not to each other. In other words, the 30% discount is applied to the original price of $120, and then the 20% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $84. Similarly, if the 20% discount is applied first, the 30% discount is applied to the already discounted price, which is $96.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: 30% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Method 2: 20% discount applied first**\n\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.\n\nThe benefits of the improved solution include:\n\n1.  **Increased Accuracy**: By verifying the net cost using two different methods, we can confirm that the solution is accurate and reliable.\n2.  **Comprehensive Approach**: The improved solution considers multiple scenarios and discount orders, making it more thorough and well-rounded.\n3.  **Future Application**: This approach can be beneficial in more complex scenarios where the order of discounts might affect the final cost. It provides a structured method for analyzing different discount orders and their impact on the net cost.\n\nGiven that the current solution provides a clear, step-by-step approach, accurately calculates the net cost in different scenarios, and effectively communicates the approach to solve the problem, I see no need for further modifications or improvements.\n\nThe final answer is: J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J.",

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."

First, we'll calculate the cost after the initial 30% discount:\n   Original price of the TV = $120\n   Discount = 30% of $120 = 0.30 \u00d7 $120 = $36\n   Cost after 30% discount = Original price - Discount\n                            = $120 - $36\n                            = $84\n\n2. Next, we'll apply the second discount of 20% on the already discounted price:\n   Discount = 20% of $84 = 0.20 \u00d7 $84 = $16.80\n   Net cost = Cost after 30% discount - Second discount\n             = $84 - $16.80\n             = $67.20\n\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% is $67.20.\n\nThe solution is J) $67.20."

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20.

Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n2. Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the case where the 20% discount is applied first, followed by the 30% discount.\n\nAlternative steps:\n1. Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n2. Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nAs we can see, applying the 20% discount first and then the 30% discount also results in a net cost of $67.20. This suggests that the order in which the discounts are applied does not affect the final net cost in this specific case.\n\nImproved solution:\nThe net cost of the $120 television set discounted at 30% and 20% can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Apply the initial 30% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.30 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $36 = $84.\n- Apply the second 20% discount to the already discounted price: $84 - (0.20 \u00d7 $84) = $84 - $16.80 = $67.20.\n\nAlternatively, the discounts can be applied in a different order:\n- Apply the initial 20% discount to the original price: $120 - (0.20 \u00d7 $120) = $120 - $24 = $96.\n- Apply the second 30% discount to the already discounted price: $96 - (0.30 \u00d7 $96) = $96 - $28.80 = $67.20.\n\nIn both cases, the net cost of the television set remains the same, which is $67.20, corresponding to option J."
