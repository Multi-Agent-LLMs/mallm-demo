As a Facilities Manager, I'm familiar with the organizational structure and job duties of various positions.\n\nFirst, a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) is usually the highest-ranking executive in a company, responsible for making strategic decisions, overseeing overall operations, and representing the company externally.\n\nOn the other hand, cleaning toilets is a task typically assigned to janitorial or maintenance staff, who are responsible for the daily upkeep and cleanliness of the building.\n\nConsidering these roles, it seems unlikely that a CEO would be involved in cleaning toilets, as their responsibilities lie in a completely different area. However, I'd like to explore this further and hear other perspectives before making a conclusion. What are your thoughts on this?"
