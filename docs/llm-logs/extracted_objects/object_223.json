The solution can be improved by adding a summary or a conclusion at the end, highlighting the key points and the final answer.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to first complete the square for the equation of the given circle to put it in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.\n\nGiven equation: $x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0$\n\nFirst, we'll complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms separately.\n\nFor the $x$ terms:\nWe can rewrite $x^2 - 24x$ as $(x^2 - 24x + 144) - 144 = (x - 12)^2 - 144$\n\nFor the $y$ terms:\nWe can rewrite $y^2 + 10y$ as $(y^2 + 10y + 25) - 25 = (y + 5)^2 - 25$\n\nNow, we put these completed squares back into the original equation and rearrange:\n$(x - 12)^2 - 144 + (y + 5)^2 - 25 + 160 = 0$\n\nLet's calculate the constant terms by grouping them and performing the operations step by step.\n\n$-144 - 25 + 160 = (-144 + 160) - 25$\n\nFirst, we calculate $-144 + 160 = 16$, which can be thought of as moving 144 units to the left from -160 and then 160 units to the right is moving 144 units away from that point. Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the shortest distance from the origin to the circle by completing the square and using the formula for the distance between two points. The final answer is 10, which is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle",

This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\nThe final answer is I."

The solution can be improved by adding a summary or a conclusion at the end, highlighting the key points and the final answer.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to first complete the square for the equation of the given circle to put it in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.\n\nGiven equation: $x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0$\n\nFirst, we'll complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms separately.\n\nFor the $x$ terms:\nWe can rewrite $x^2 - 24x$ as $(x^2 - 24x + 144) - 144 = (x - 12)^2 - 144$\n\nFor the $y$ terms:\nWe can rewrite $y^2 + 10y$ as $(y^2 + 10y + 25) - 25 = (y + 5)^2 - 25$\n\nNow, we put these completed squares back into the original equation and rearrange:\n$(x - 12)^2 - 144 + (y + 5)^2 - 25 + 160 = 0$\n\nLet's calculate the constant terms by grouping them and performing the operations step by step.\n\n$-144 - 25 + 160 = (-144 + 160) - 25$\n\nFirst, we calculate $-144 + 160 = 16$, which can be thought of as moving 144 units to the left from -160 and then 160 units to the right is moving 144 units away from that point. Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the shortest distance from the origin to the circle by completing the square and using the formula for the distance between two points. The final answer is 10, which is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle"

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the shortest distance from the origin to the circle by completing the square and using the formula for the distance between two points. The final answer is 10, which is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle"

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the shortest distance from the origin to the circle by completing the square and using the formula for the distance between two points. The final answer is 10, which is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle"

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I.",

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nThis diagram shows the circle with its center at (12, -5) and radius 3. The origin is at (0, 0). The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe final answer is I."

Then, subtract 25 from this result to obtain $-9$.\n\n$16 - 25 = -9$\n\nNow we can write the equation with the new constant term.\n\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 9 = 0$\n$(x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9$\nComparing this with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, we see the center is $(12, -5)$ and the radius $r$ is 3, which can be found by taking the square root of the value on the right-hand side:\n$r^2 = 9$\n$r = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nTo find the shortest distance from the origin $(0, 0)$ to the circle, we calculate the distance from the origin to the center of the circle and subtract the radius. This is because the shortest distance will be a straight line that intersects the circle at its closest point to the origin, which is the radius away from the center.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the center is:\n$\\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = \\sqrt{13^2} = 13$\n\nSubtracting the radius:\n$13 - 3 = 10$\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 10.\n\n[Visual representation of the problem]\n\nHere is a simple diagram illustrating the concept of the shortest distance from the origin to the circle:\n\n Circle with center at (12, -5) and radius 3\n Origin at (0, 0)\n Shortest distance from origin to circle: 10\n\nIn conclusion, we have found the shortest distance from the origin to the circle by completing the square and using the formula for the distance between two points. The final answer is 10, which is the shortest distance from the origin to the circle"
