For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"

For the H-Cl bond in HCl, the Cl atom would acquire the full electron charge (e = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu). \n\nThe ionic dipole moment (u_ionic) is the product of this charge and the bond distance (r):\n\nu_ionic = e * r\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \\AA\n\nWe convert \\AA to cm: 1 \\AA = 10^-8 cm\n\nu_ionic = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-18 esu * 1.28 \u00d7 10^-8 cm\nu_ionic = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm = 6.144 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm * (1 D / (3.33 \u00d7 10^-26 esu*cm))\nu_ionic \u2248 1.84 D\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percent ionic character of the bond.\n\nWe use the observed dipole moment (u_obs) and compare it to the ionic dipole moment (u_ionic):\n\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n\nGiven observed dipole moment u_obs = 1.03 D and the calculated ionic dipole moment u_ionic \u2248 1.84 D:\n\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 1.84) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 56 % (56% of 1.84 would be 1.0304)\n\n\nThat doesn't make sense as dipole moments had the same scales; you were correct so use (u_obs = 1.03 D, u_ionic \u2248 6.144 D)\nLet me recalculate:\n% Ionic character = (u_obs / u_ionic) * 100%\n% Ionic character = (1.03 / 6.144) * 100%\n% Ionic character \u2248 16.8%\n\nThe answer corresponds to D) 16.8%"
