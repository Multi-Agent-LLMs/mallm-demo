The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g",

Both solutions are clear, concise, and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, I would suggest a minor modification to the solution to make it even more clear and self-explanatory.

The revised solution is indeed clear, concise, and easy to follow. The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1.

Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

The revised solution is indeed clear, concise, and easy to follow. The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1.

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

Both solutions are clear, concise, and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, I would suggest a minor modification to the solution to make it even more clear and self-explanatory.

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, I would like to provide a minor improvement to the solution by adding a note about significant figures.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71 or 32.7g when rounded to one decimal place\n\n**Note:** The answer is rounded to one decimal place to match the answer choices, but it's worth noting that the actual calculation yields a more precise result.

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, I would like to provide a minor improvement to the solution by adding a summary of the calculation at the end.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nThis revised solution maintains the clarity and conciseness of the original solution while providing additional explanation and minor reorganization for easier understanding."

Convert the given information into manageable numbers:\n   - m = 3.27g (mass of zinc)\n   - I = 5.36 A (current)\n   - t = 30 * 60 s = 1800s (time in seconds)\n3. Plug the numbers into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n4. Perform the calculation: \n   - E = 3.27 * 96500 / (5.36 * 1800)\n   - E \u2248 3.27 * 96500 / 9648\n   - E \u2248 32.71 or rounded 32.7 grams\n\nThis calculation correctly leads to the equivalent weight of zinc, confirming that the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7 g.\n\nThe original solution was on the right track but became convoluted with excessive rewriting. The Electrochemist's solution is more straightforward and effectively leads to the correct answer."

This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match.

This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match.

The revised solution is indeed clear, concise, and easy to follow. The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

The revised solution is indeed clear, concise, and easy to follow. The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3.

The additional explanations and notes provide extra context and help to clarify the solution.\n\nThe solution is well-organized, and the step-by-step approach makes it easy to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nThe formulas and calculations are correct, and the use of headings and notes helps to clarify the calculation and provide additional context.\n\nThe additional explanation of the concept of equivalent weight provides a clear understanding of the topic, which is a bonus for the readers.\n\nNo further improvements are needed, as the current solution is already excellent.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"

Here is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator and simplify the expression:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n  There is a possibility for simplification using a calculator to simplify this fraction before performing long division.\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71 or 32.7g when rounded to a tenth\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nRounded to one decimal place to match answer choices, the equivalent weight of zinc is approximately 32.7 grams.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g",

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I suggest considering the following minor refinement:\n\n**Additional Example or Explanation**\n\nTo make the solution even more accessible to a broader audience, consider adding an additional example or a brief explanation of the concept of equivalent weight. This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match.

Here is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nThis revised solution maintains the clarity and conciseness of the original solution while providing additional explanation and minor reorganization for easier understanding."

This can help to reinforce understanding and provide additional context for those who may not be familiar with the topic.\n\nHere is the revised solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match.

The step-by-step approach makes it easier to understand the problem and the calculation.\n\nThe solution is well-supported by the formulas and calculations, and the use of headings and notes helps to clarify the calculation and provide additional context.\n\nThe additional refinement suggested by the Electrolysis Calculator provides a clear understanding of the concept of equivalent weight, which is a bonus for the readers.\n\nThe current solution is already excellent, and I do not see any need for further improvements.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the current solution, and the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nTo summarize the current solution:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are given:\n- m = 3.27g (mass of zinc deposited at the cathode)\n- I = 5.36 A (current passed through the electrolytic cell)\n- t = 30 min = 1800s (time in seconds, converted from 30 minutes)\n\nWe need to find the equivalent weight of zinc in the salt.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Formula**\nThe equivalent weight of an element can be found using Faraday's Law, which is given by the formula:\nE = (m * 96500) / (I * t)\n\nwhere:\n- E = equivalent weight of the element (in g)\n- m = mass of the element deposited (in g)\n- I = current passed through the electrolytic cell (in A)\n- t = time in seconds\n- 96500 is the Faraday constant (in C/mol)\n\n**Step 3: Plugging in the Values**\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Calculation**\nTo simplify the calculation, first calculate the denominator:\n5.36 A * 1800s = 9648\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\nE = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n\n**Step 5: Breaking Down the Calculation**\nTo make the calculation easier to understand, let's break it down into two steps:\n- First, calculate the numerator:\n  3.27g * 96500 = 315,515\n- Then, divide the numerator by the denominator using a calculator to get a more accurate result:\n  E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n\n**Step 6: Rounding the Answer**\nSince the answer choices have one decimal place, we will round our answer to match. The closest answer to 32.71 when rounded to one decimal place is 32.7.\n\n**Note:** The actual calculation yields a more precise result of 32.71, but for the purpose of this problem, rounding to one decimal place is sufficient.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\nTo summarize, we calculated the equivalent weight of zinc by:\n\n1. Plugging the values into the formula: E = (3.27g * 96500) / (5.36 A * 1800s)\n2. Simplifying the calculation: E = (3.27g * 96500) / 9648\n3. Breaking down the calculation: E \u2248 315,515 / 9648 \u2248 32.71\n4. Rounding the answer to one decimal place: 32.7\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\nThe concept of equivalent weight is an important aspect of electrochemistry, as it allows us to relate the mass of a substance to its ability to participate in chemical reactions. The equivalent weight of an element is defined as the mass of the element that will react with (or displace) one mole of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is indeed option F) 32.7g.\n\nAnswer: F) 32.7g"
