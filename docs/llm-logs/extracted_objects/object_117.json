We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

When calculating the natural logarithm part, it was approximated to 0.0388 which led to a slightly different answer.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

Let's re-evaluate the last steps:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(1.0393) + 0.00737*25\n\nCalculating the natural logarithm more accurately:\n\nln(1.0393) = 0.0381\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0381 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1723 + 0.1843\n\u0394s = 0.3566\n\nNone of the options exactly match our solution. However, option E) 0.3588 Btu/lbm is still the closest, but this minor discrepancy could stem from rounding differences. Given the options, E remains the best choice.\n\nImproved Solution:\nE) 0.3588 Btu/lbm (In the absence of more precise options)\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the options or rephrase the question to include more precise calculations."

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options. But option E is 0.3588, which is the closest.\n\nMy proposed answer is E) 0.3588 Btu/lbm"

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

Let's re-evaluate the last steps:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(1.0393) + 0.00737*25\n\nCalculating the natural logarithm more accurately:\n\nln(1.0393) = 0.0381\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0381 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1723 + 0.1843\n\u0394s = 0.3566\n\nNone of the options exactly match our solution. However, option E) 0.3588 Btu/lbm is still the closest, but this minor discrepancy could stem from rounding differences. Given the options, E remains the best choice.\n\nImproved Solution:\nE) 0.3588 Btu/lbm (In the absence of more precise options)\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the options or rephrase the question to include more precise calculations."

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

Let's re-evaluate the last steps:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(1.0393) + 0.00737*25\n\nCalculating the natural logarithm more accurately:\n\nln(1.0393) = 0.0381\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0381 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1723 + 0.1843\n\u0394s = 0.3566\n\nNone of the options exactly match our solution. However, option E) 0.3588 Btu/lbm is still the closest, but this minor discrepancy could stem from rounding differences. Given the options, E remains the best choice.\n\nImproved Solution:\nE) 0.3588 Btu/lbm (In the absence of more precise options)\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the options or rephrase the question to include more precise calculations."

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

We'll do this by adding 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperatures:\nT1 = 175\u00b0F + 459.67 = 634.67 R\nT2 = 200\u00b0F + 459.67 = 659.67 R\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for c_v and T into the integral:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we can break it down into two parts:\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\nEvaluating each part separately, we get:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0388 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1756 + 0.1845\n\u0394s = 0.3601\n\nHowever, in this case, our values don't exactly match any of the options.

Let's re-evaluate the last steps:\n\n\u0394s = \u222b( (4.52 + 0.00737T) / T ) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = \u222b(4.52/T) dT + \u222b(0.00737) dT from T1 to T2\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(T2/T1) + 0.00737*(T2-T1)\n\nNow, let's substitute the values:\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(659.67/634.67) + 0.00737*(659.67-634.67)\n\u0394s = 4.52*ln(1.0393) + 0.00737*25\n\nCalculating the natural logarithm more accurately:\n\nln(1.0393) = 0.0381\n\n\u0394s = 4.52*0.0381 + 0.00737*25\n\u0394s = 0.1723 + 0.1843\n\u0394s = 0.3566\n\nNone of the options exactly match our solution. However, option E) 0.3588 Btu/lbm is still the closest, but this minor discrepancy could stem from rounding differences. Given the options, E remains the best choice.\n\nImproved Solution:\nE) 0.3588 Btu/lbm (In the absence of more precise options)\n\nSuggestion: Re-evaluate the options or rephrase the question to include more precise calculations."
