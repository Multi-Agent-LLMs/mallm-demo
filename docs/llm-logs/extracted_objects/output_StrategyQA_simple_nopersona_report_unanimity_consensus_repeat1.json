Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"

Conversely, a prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Determine if 1946 is a composite number**:\n   - To check if 1946 is composite, we need to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - 1946 can be divided by 2 (since it's even), which gives us 973. So, 2 and 973 are divisors of 1946.\n   - Since we've found divisors other than 1 and 1946 itself, 1946 is a composite number.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer to whether Casio's founding year is a composite number is:\n\nA) Yes"
