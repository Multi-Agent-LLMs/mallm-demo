The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nThe provided explanation and calculations are clear and easy to follow. The solution correctly identifies the formula, determines the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval, uses a conservative estimate for the population proportion, correctly calculates the margin of error, and plugs the values into the formula to obtain the sample size.\n\nThe minor additions made to the solution, such as explaining the use of 0.5 as a conservative estimate and mentioning alternative methods for obtaining the Z-score, further enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the solution.\n\nOverall, the solution is well-structured and provides a step-by-step approach to calculating the required sample size.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I would suggest adding a brief discussion on the assumptions made when using this formula and the potential limitations of the approach. For example:\n\n- The formula assumes that the sample is randomly selected from the population, and that the sample size is sufficiently large.\n- The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval.

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I would suggest some minor improvements to make the solution more clear and concise.\n\nImproved Solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations:\n\n\nThis approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIn conclusion, the required sample size to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students. This sample size provides a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I would suggest some minor improvements to make the solution more clear and concise.\n\nImproved Solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations:\n\n\nThis approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIn conclusion, the required sample size to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students. This sample size provides a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\nIt is essential to note that this approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number is not necessary for this test.\n\nSo, the required sample size is approximately 423 students.\n\nIn conclusion, the sample size required to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students, with a confidence interval width of at most 0.08.

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I would suggest some minor improvements to make the solution more clear and concise.\n\nImproved Solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations:\n\n\nThis approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIn conclusion, the required sample size to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students. This sample size provides a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I would suggest some minor improvements to make the solution more clear and concise.\n\nImproved Solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations:\n\n\nThis approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIn conclusion, the required sample size to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students. This sample size provides a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I would suggest some minor improvements to make the solution more clear and concise.\n\nImproved Solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations:\n\n\nThis approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nIn conclusion, the required sample size to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students. This sample size provides a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

This would help to reinforce the main points and provide a clear final answer.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\nIt is essential to note that this approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number is not necessary for this test.\n\nSo, the required sample size is approximately 423 students.\n\nIn conclusion, the sample size required to estimate the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly is approximately 423 students, with a confidence interval width of at most 0.08. This calculation assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. While the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion may result in a larger sample size than necessary, it ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nThe final answer is indeed C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nThe provided explanation and calculations are clear and easy to follow. The solution correctly identifies the formula, determines the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval, uses a conservative estimate for the population proportion, correctly calculates the margin of error, and plugs the values into the formula to obtain the sample size.\n\nThe minor additions made to the solution, such as explaining the use of 0.5 as a conservative estimate and mentioning alternative methods for obtaining the Z-score, further enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the solution.\n\nOverall, the solution is well-structured and provides a step-by-step approach to calculating the required sample size.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I would suggest adding a brief discussion on the assumptions made when using this formula and the potential limitations of the approach. For example:\n\n- The formula assumes that the sample is randomly selected from the population, and that the sample size is sufficiently large.\n- The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval.

This would help to reinforce the main points and provide a clear final answer.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval.

The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nThe provided explanation and calculations are clear and easy to follow. The solution correctly identifies the formula, determines the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval, uses a conservative estimate for the population proportion, correctly calculates the margin of error, and plugs the values into the formula to obtain the sample size.\n\nThe minor additions made to the solution, such as explaining the use of 0.5 as a conservative estimate and mentioning alternative methods for obtaining the Z-score, further enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the solution.\n\nOverall, the solution is well-structured and provides a step-by-step approach to calculating the required sample size.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I would suggest adding a brief discussion on the assumptions made when using this formula and the potential limitations of the approach. For example:\n\n- The formula assumes that the sample is randomly selected from the population, and that the sample size is sufficiently large.\n- The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval.

For example:\n\n- The formula assumes that the sample is randomly selected from the population, and that the sample size is sufficiently large.\n- The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\nIt is essential to note that this approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion may result in a larger sample size than necessary.\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number is not necessary for this test.\n\nSo, the required sample size is approximately 423 students.\n\nThe final answer is indeed C.\n\nHowever, since the original solution was already correct, I will stick with the original agreement:\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The biostatistician has properly applied the formula for calculating the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error.\n\nHowever, I agree with the Research Methodologist that adding a final check section to verify the accuracy of the calculation and ensure that the obtained sample size is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error would further enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the solution.\n\nThe added final check section effectively verifies the accuracy of the calculation and ensures that the obtained sample size is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nTo further improve the solution, I would suggest providing a clear and concise summary of the key findings and takeaways in the conclusion section, highlighting the most important results and implications of the analysis.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval.

For example:\n\n- The formula assumes that the sample is randomly selected from the population, and that the sample size is sufficiently large.\n- The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion (0.5) may result in a larger sample size than necessary, but ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nThe formula for the sample size required to estimate a population proportion with a specified margin of error is:\n\nn = (Z^2 \\* p \\* (1 - p)) / E^2\n\nWhere:\n- n is the required sample size\n- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (in this case, 90%)\n- p is the estimated population proportion (since we don't know it, we'll use 0.5 as a conservative estimate, which maximizes the sample size and ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08)\n- E is the margin of error (also known as the desired width of the confidence interval), which in this case is 0.08/2 = 0.04 (half the desired width).\n\nFirst, we need to find the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval. From a standard Z-table or using statistical software/calculators, the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nn = (1.645^2 \\* 0.5 \\* (1 - 0.5)) / 0.04^2\nn = (2.706 \\* 0.25) / 0.0016\nn = 0.6765 / 0.0016\nn \u2248 423\n\nIt is essential to note that this approach assumes a random sample selection and a sufficiently large sample size. Additionally, the use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion may result in a larger sample size than necessary.\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number is not necessary for this test.\n\nSo, the required sample size is approximately 423 students.\n\nThe final answer is indeed C.\n\nHowever, since the original solution was already correct, I will stick with the original agreement:\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."

The use of a conservative estimate for the population proportion ensures that the confidence interval width is at most 0.08.\n\n\nFinal Check:\n\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the calculation, we can check that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is indeed sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\n\nLet's calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimated population proportion (p):\n\n\np - E \u2264 p \u2264 p + E\n0.5 - 0.04 \u2264 p \u2264 0.5 + 0.04\n0.46 \u2264 p \u2264 0.54\n\n\nSince the confidence interval width is at most 0.08, we can conclude that the obtained sample size (n \u2248 423) is sufficient to estimate the population proportion with the desired margin of error.\n\nThe final answer remains the same: C."
