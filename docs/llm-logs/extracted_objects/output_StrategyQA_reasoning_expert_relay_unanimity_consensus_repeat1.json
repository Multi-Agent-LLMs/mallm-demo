Michael Crichton was a highly accomplished individual, known not only for his writing but also for his academic achievements. \n\nWe know that Crichton studied biological anthropology at Harvard College, where he earned his undergraduate degree. His academic prowess and interests are well-documented, but the specific details about his academic performance, such as grades or any challenges he might have faced, are not immediately clear without further information.\n\nIt's also worth considering that Crichton went on to attend Harvard Medical School after completing his undergraduate degree, which suggests a strong academic foundation. However, the question at hand is about his time as an undergraduate and whether he was in danger of flunking out.\n\nLet's gather more information about his undergraduate years to make an informed decision."
