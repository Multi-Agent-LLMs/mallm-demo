The step-by-step analysis correctly compares and orders the given numbers from greatest to least.\n\nTo improve the current solution, let's precisely rewrite the reasoning with a focus on clarity and concision:\n\n1. Convert '3 and 1 over 8' to its decimal equivalent: 3 + 1/8 = 3.125.\n2. Compare the given numbers:\n   - 3.8 is the greatest.\n   - 3.18 comes next.\n   - 3.125 is greater than 3 but less than 3.18.\n   - 3 is the smallest among the decimal numbers.\n\nConsidering the options, the correct order from greatest to least is indeed:\n3.8, 3.18, 3.125, and lastly the number that just says 3.\n\nThis precise ordering confirms that the current solution, E) 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1 over 8, 3, is correct.\n\nHence, the correct answer, with its letter, is E."

Compare the given numbers:\n   - 3.8 is the greatest.\n   - 3.18 comes next.\n   - 3.125 is greater than 3 but less than 3.18.\n   - 3 is the smallest among the decimal numbers.\n\nConsidering the options, the correct order from greatest to least is indeed:\n3.8, 3.18, 3.125, and lastly the number that just says 3.\n\nThis precise ordering confirms that the current solution, E) 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1 over 8, 3, is correct.\n\nHence, the correct answer, with its letter, is E."

Compare the given numbers:\n   - 3.8 is the greatest.\n   - 3.18 comes next.\n   - 3.125 is greater than 3 but less than 3.18.\n   - 3 is the smallest among the decimal numbers.\n\nConsidering the options, the correct order from greatest to least is indeed:\n3.8, 3.18, 3.125, and lastly the number that just says 3.\n\nThis precise ordering confirms that the current solution, E) 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1 over 8, 3, is correct.\n\nHence, the correct answer, with its letter, is E."

Compare the given numbers:\n   - 3.8 is the greatest.\n   - 3.18 comes next.\n   - 3.125 is greater than 3 but less than 3.18.\n   - 3 is the smallest among the decimal numbers.\n\nConsidering the options, the correct order from greatest to least is indeed:\n3.8, 3.18, 3.125, and lastly the number that just says 3.\n\nThis precise ordering confirms that the current solution, E) 3.8, 3.18, 3 and 1 over 8, 3, is correct.\n\nHence, the correct answer, with its letter, is E."
