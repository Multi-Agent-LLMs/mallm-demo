Examples include rifle shooting, pistol shooting, and shotgun sports.\n\n2. **Archery**: This is a shooting sport that involves using a bow to propel arrows at a target. It does not involve bullets.\n\n3. **Airsoft and Paintball**: These are recreational shooting sports where participants use guns that fire plastic pellets (airsoft) or paintballs, respectively. Neither of these involves bullets.\n\n4. **Crossbow Shooting**: Similar to archery, crossbow shooting involves propelling a projectile (a bolt) at a target without using bullets.\n\nGiven this diversity in shooting sports, it's clear that not all of them involve the use of bullets.
