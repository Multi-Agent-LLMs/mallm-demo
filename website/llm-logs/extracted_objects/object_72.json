The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution.

              "content": "Thermodynamics Engineer: To solve this problem, we can use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law is often represented in a differential form as dQ = dU + dW for a unit mass of substance in a system, where dQ is the amount of heat transferred into the system, dU is the change in internal energy of the system and dW is the work done by the system. In the context of this problem, where we are dealing with Btu/lb (British Thermal Units per pound), we can express the first law as Q = \u0394U + W.\n\nGiven information:\n- \u0394U (Change in internal energy) = 40 Btu/lb\n- W (Work done) = 70 Btu/lb\n\nHowever, we must understand that the work done in a compression process is generally negative since it's work is done on the system. Thus, for calculating the amount of heat transferred Q, we should take W as -70 Btu/lb.\n\nNow we apply the formula to get Q (amount of heat transferred).\n\nQ = \u0394U + W\nQ = 40 + (-70 Btu/lb)\nQ = 40 - 70 Btu/lb\nQ = -30 Btu/lb\n\nLet's examine the given options to see which ones fit our solution. None of the given options match exactly -30 Btu/lb but we have one answer -30.37 Btu/lb which I closely match what our statement was."
