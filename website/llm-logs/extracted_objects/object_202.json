This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available. The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available. The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available. The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available. The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%.

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available. The slight discrepancy between the estimates (5% versus 6.8%) highlights the complexity of measuring and tracking global poverty rates.\n\nAn improved solution should take into account this corrected figure, providing a more accurate representation of the world population living in extreme poverty as of 2019.\n\nSince none of the provided options (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) match this corrected figure of 6.8%, the best approach is to indicate this discrepancy and suggest revising the options or the question to reflect the accurate data.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format and instructions given, which involve selecting one of the provided options as the best solution, I must acknowledge the nearest figure to the actual number of 6.8%, which is around 5%.

This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This threshold is used by the World Bank to track progress toward the first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty by 2030.\n\n2. **Global Trends**: The world has seen a significant reduction in extreme poverty over the past few decades. Factors contributing to this decline include economic growth, improved education, and specific poverty reduction programs.\n\n3. **Data as of 2019**: According to the World Bank, by 2019, there was a notable decrease in the global poverty rate. This decline is partly due to sustained economic growth in regions like Asia and improvements in social services in many countries.\n\n4. **The Right Percentage**: Given the context and progress made globally to reduce extreme poverty, it is reasonable to consider options that reflect a significant reduction, but also acknowledge that completely eradicating poverty is challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the most plausible answer that aligns with global economic trends and poverty reduction efforts as of 2019 would be around 5%. Extreme poverty has been declining significantly, but completely ending it remains a challenge.\n\n**Solution: E) 5%**"

This percentage is based on the best available data and reflects the global effort to reduce poverty, taking into account the significant advancements made in Asia, improvements in social services, and the impact of economic growth.\n\nGiven this information, the initial conclusions, while well-intentioned and instructive, might not accurately represent the most recent data available.
