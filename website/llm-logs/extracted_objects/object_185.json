The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]. However, we can rearrange the equation for K_d to solve for the ratio:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = K_d / [NH_3]^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13 / (1 M)^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\nFor the second calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [NH_3], but we know that the conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ is 50 %.\n\nLet [Cu^2+]_0 be the initial concentration of Cu^2+. Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F.",

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]. However, we can rearrange the equation for K_d to solve for the ratio:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = K_d / [NH_3]^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13 / (1 M)^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\nFor the second calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [NH_3], but we know that the conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ is 50 %.\n\nLet [Cu^2+]_0 be the initial concentration of Cu^2+. Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+].

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+].

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+].

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]. However, we can rearrange the equation for K_d to solve for the ratio:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = K_d / [NH_3]^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13 / (1 M)^4\n= 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\nFor the second calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [NH_3], but we know that the conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ is 50 %.\n\nLet [Cu^2+]_0 be the initial concentration of Cu^2+. Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+].

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The K_d value is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWe need to calculate two things:\n\n(1) The ratio of Cu^2+ ion to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+ in a solution 1 M in NH_3.\n(2) The equilibrium concentration of NH_3 needed to attain 50 % conversion of Cu^2+ to Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+.\n\nTo solve these problems, we need to use the expression for the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n\nSince the solution is 1 M in NH_3, we can plug in [NH_3] = 1 M.\n\nFor the first calculation, we are not given [Cu^2+] or [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+].

Then, after 50 % conversion, [Cu^2+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0 and [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 0.5 [Cu^2+]_0.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for K_d:\n\nK_d = [Cu^2+][NH_3]^4 / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+]\n= (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0) * [NH_3]^4 / (0.5 [Cu^2+]_0)\n= [NH_3]^4\n\nK_d = 2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\n[NH_3]^4 = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n[NH_3] = (2 \u00d7 10^-13)^(1/4)\n\u2248 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nComparing the results to the options, we find that they match option F:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nThe solution is F."

The assumption of high NH_3 concentration (1 M) allows us to neglect the competition with H_3O^+, and we can simplify the equation to get:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = K_d\n\nUsing the given K_d value of 2 \u00d7 10^-13, we can calculate the ratio [Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] as follows:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13\n\nThis is a simplified and accurate solution, considering the assumptions made.\n\nThe solution for the second part of the question remains the same, with [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[Cu^2+] / [Cu(NH_3)^2_4^+] = 2 \u00d7 10^-13, [NH_3] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nOption F is correct.\n\nThe final answer is indeed F, and no further improvement is needed.\n\nIt's worth noting that this solution assumes a high concentration of NH_3 (1 M) and neglects the competition with H_3O^+. This simplification may not be valid for lower concentrations of NH_3.\n\nThe answer is F."
