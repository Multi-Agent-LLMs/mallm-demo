In this problem, we are given the wavelength of one of the sodium-D lines and asked to calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with this line. This calculation is essential in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm using the correct conversion factor:\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\nGiven wavelength in \u00c5: \u03bb (\u00c5) = 5890 \u00c5\n\nConvert to cm: \u03bb (cm) = 5890 \u00c5 \u00d7 (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nStep 2: Use Planck's constant (h) in erg-sec: h = 6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec (no unit conversion needed).\n\nStep 3: Use the speed of light (c) in cm/s: c = 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s (cgs unit system).\n\nStep 4: Apply the formula E = hc / \u03bb:\n\nE (erg) = h (erg-sec) \u00d7 c (cm/s) / \u03bb (cm)\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation using the associative property of multiplication:\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / (5.89)\n\nStep 6: Perform the final division:\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line can be calculated using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. By converting the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm, using Planck's constant in erg-sec, and the speed of light in cm/s, and simplifying the equation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Key Points and Assumptions**\n\n* The calculation assumes that the given wavelength is accurate and corresponds to the sodium-D line.\n* The calculation uses the cgs unit system for consistency.\n* The associative property of multiplication is used to simplify the equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer remains:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg",

To use the above formula, we need to convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to centimeters, since we are working in the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) unit system.\n\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\u03bb = 5890 \u00c5 = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nNow, we need the speed of light (c) in the cgs unit system.

The step-by-step breakdown of the calculation is thorough and effectively addresses all aspects of the problem.\n\nHowever, to further improve the solution, I would suggest adding a brief introduction to explain the context and significance of the problem. This would help readers understand the relevance of the calculation and the underlying physics.\n\nAdditionally, a summary of the key points and assumptions made in the solution would be useful for readers who want a quick overview of the calculation.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe calculation of the energy of electronic transitions is a fundamental concept in atomic physics. In this problem, we are given the wavelength of one of the sodium-D lines and asked to calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with this line. This calculation is essential in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm using the correct conversion factor:\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\nGiven wavelength in \u00c5: \u03bb (\u00c5) = 5890 \u00c5\n\nConvert to cm: \u03bb (cm) = 5890 \u00c5 \u00d7 (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nStep 2: Use Planck's constant (h) in erg-sec: h = 6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec (no unit conversion needed).\n\nStep 3: Use the speed of light (c) in cm/s: c = 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s (cgs unit system).\n\nStep 4: Apply the formula E = hc / \u03bb:\n\nE (erg) = h (erg-sec) \u00d7 c (cm/s) / \u03bb (cm)\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation using the associative property of multiplication:\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / (5.89)\n\nStep 6: Perform the final division:\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line can be calculated using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. By converting the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm, using Planck's constant in erg-sec, and the speed of light in cm/s, and simplifying the equation, we arrive at the final answer:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Key Points and Assumptions**\n\n* The calculation assumes that the given wavelength is accurate and corresponds to the sodium-D line.\n* The calculation uses the cgs unit system for consistency.\n* The associative property of multiplication is used to simplify the equation.\n\nThis improved solution provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, and a summary of the key points and assumptions made.",

In this problem, we are given the wavelength of one of the sodium-D lines and asked to calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with this line. This calculation is essential in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm using the correct conversion factor:\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\nGiven wavelength in \u00c5: \u03bb (\u00c5) = 5890 \u00c5\n\nConvert to cm: \u03bb (cm) = 5890 \u00c5 \u00d7 (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nStep 2: Use Planck's constant (h) in erg-sec: h = 6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec (no unit conversion needed).\n\nStep 3: Use the speed of light (c) in cm/s: c = 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s (cgs unit system).\n\nStep 4: Apply the formula E = hc / \u03bb:\n\nE (erg) = h (erg-sec) \u00d7 c (cm/s) / \u03bb (cm)\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation using the associative property of multiplication:\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / (5.89)\n\nStep 6: Perform the final division:\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line can be calculated using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. By converting the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm, using Planck's constant in erg-sec, and the speed of light in cm/s, and simplifying the equation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Key Points and Assumptions**\n\n* The calculation assumes that the given wavelength is accurate and corresponds to the sodium-D line.\n* The calculation uses the cgs unit system for consistency.\n* The associative property of multiplication is used to simplify the equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer remains:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg",

To use the above formula, we need to convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to centimeters, since we are working in the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) unit system.\n\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\u03bb = 5890 \u00c5 = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nNow, we need the speed of light (c) in the cgs unit system. It is approximately equal to 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s.\n\nNow we have all the required values to calculate the energy of the transition:\n\nE = hc / \u03bb\nE = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\nE = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / 5.89\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg"

To use the above formula, we need to convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to centimeters, since we are working in the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) unit system.\n\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\u03bb = 5890 \u00c5 = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nNow, we need the speed of light (c) in the cgs unit system. It is approximately equal to 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s.\n\nNow we have all the required values to calculate the energy of the transition:\n\nE = hc / \u03bb\nE = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\nE = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / 5.89\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg"

In this problem, we are given the wavelength of one of the sodium-D lines and asked to calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with this line. This calculation is essential in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm using the correct conversion factor:\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\nGiven wavelength in \u00c5: \u03bb (\u00c5) = 5890 \u00c5\n\nConvert to cm: \u03bb (cm) = 5890 \u00c5 \u00d7 (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nStep 2: Use Planck's constant (h) in erg-sec: h = 6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec (no unit conversion needed).\n\nStep 3: Use the speed of light (c) in cm/s: c = 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s (cgs unit system).\n\nStep 4: Apply the formula E = hc / \u03bb:\n\nE (erg) = h (erg-sec) \u00d7 c (cm/s) / \u03bb (cm)\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation using the associative property of multiplication:\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / (5.89)\n\nStep 6: Perform the final division:\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line can be calculated using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. By converting the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm, using Planck's constant in erg-sec, and the speed of light in cm/s, and simplifying the equation, we arrive at the final answer:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Key Points and Assumptions**\n\n* The calculation assumes that the given wavelength is accurate and corresponds to the sodium-D line.\n* The calculation uses the cgs unit system for consistency.\n* The associative property of multiplication is used to simplify the equation.\n\nThis improved solution provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, and a summary of the key points and assumptions made.",

In this problem, we are given the wavelength of one of the sodium-D lines and asked to calculate the energy of the electronic transition associated with this line. This calculation is essential in understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\nStep 1: Convert the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm using the correct conversion factor:\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm\n\nGiven wavelength in \u00c5: \u03bb (\u00c5) = 5890 \u00c5\n\nConvert to cm: \u03bb (cm) = 5890 \u00c5 \u00d7 (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 5890 \u00d7 10^-8 cm = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm\n\nStep 2: Use Planck's constant (h) in erg-sec: h = 6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec (no unit conversion needed).\n\nStep 3: Use the speed of light (c) in cm/s: c = 3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s (cgs unit system).\n\nStep 4: Apply the formula E = hc / \u03bb:\n\nE (erg) = h (erg-sec) \u00d7 c (cm/s) / \u03bb (cm)\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 10^-27 erg-sec) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^10 cm/s) / (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 cm)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation using the associative property of multiplication:\nE (erg) = (6.62 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-27 + 10 - (-5)) / (5.89)\nE (erg) = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / (5.89)\n\nStep 6: Perform the final division:\nE = 19.86 \u00d7 10^(-12) / 5.89\nE = 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D line can be calculated using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. By converting the wavelength from \u00c5 to cm, using Planck's constant in erg-sec, and the speed of light in cm/s, and simplifying the equation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Key Points and Assumptions**\n\n* The calculation assumes that the given wavelength is accurate and corresponds to the sodium-D line.\n* The calculation uses the cgs unit system for consistency.\n* The associative property of multiplication is used to simplify the equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer remains:\n\nF) 3.37 \u00d7 10^-12 erg",
