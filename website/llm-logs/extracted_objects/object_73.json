Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F",

The application of the holographic principle, the derivation of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths, and the step-by-step solution are all accurate.\n\nThe conclusion that the reconstructed image distance (d\u2082) is equal to (5/6) the object distance (d\u2081) is still correct, and the correct answer remains F.\n\nThe modified solution is a minor but positive improvement over the original solution, making it clearer and more understandable. Therefore, I agree with the modified solution.\n\nModified Solution:\n\n\"We can apply the principles of holography to solve this problem. When a hologram is recorded with light of a certain wavelength (\u03bb\u2081) and then reconstructed with light of a different wavelength (\u03bb\u2082), the image distance can be scaled.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. Using the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F"

To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nSince I agree with the current solution, no changes are needed."

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed."

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nSolution: F"

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nSince I agree with the current solution, no changes are needed.",

In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F"

In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F"

In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed.",

To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength.

In holography, the relationship between object distance and image distance can be derived from the interference pattern recorded in the hologram.\n\nWhen a hologram is recorded with light of a certain wavelength (\u03bb1) and then reconstructed with light of a different wavelength (\u03bb2), the image distance can be scaled.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\n d\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb1)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb2\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082.

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F"

To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.",

The step-by-step solution is logical and easy to follow, and it correctly concludes that the reconstructed image distance (d\u2082) is equal to (5/6) the object distance (d\u2081).\n\nThe added summary provides a clear and concise overview of the solution, making it easier for readers to quickly understand the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the improved solution:\n\nSolution:\n\n\"When a hologram is recorded with light of a certain wavelength (\u03bb\u2081) and then reconstructed with light of a different wavelength (\u03bb\u2082), the image distance can be scaled. To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed.",

When a hologram is recorded with light of a certain wavelength (\u03bb\u2081) and then reconstructed with light of a different wavelength (\u03bb\u2082), the image distance can be scaled.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. Using the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082.

I do not see any need for further improvement.\n\nModified Solution:\n\n\"When a hologram is recorded with light of a certain wavelength (\u03bb\u2081) and then reconstructed with light of a different wavelength (\u03bb\u2082), the image distance can be scaled. To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F",

This is already implied in the solution, but a brief clarification could help to avoid any potential confusion.\n\nHere is the modified solution with the suggested clarification:\n\n\"We can apply the principles of holography to solve this problem.

Using the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082.

In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.

To understand this scaling, we need to consider the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths.\n\nConsidering the original recording wavelength (\u03bb\u2081 = 600 nm), the object distance and image distance during reconstruction are related to the wavelength. In other words, the object distance and image distance measured during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081 will be different from the actual object distance and image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082.\n\nUsing the principles of holography, the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths can be described by:\n\nd\u2082 / d\u2081 = \u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081\n\nwhere:\n\n- d\u2081 is the object distance (or image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081)\n- d\u2082 is the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082\n- \u03bb\u2081 is the wavelength of light during recording (600 nm)\n- \u03bb\u2082 is the wavelength of light during reconstruction (500 nm)\n\nWe need to find d\u2082, the image distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2082. Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance.

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed."

Since the reconstructed image distance is a function of the object distance, we can say that d\u2081 is equal to the object distance during reconstruction with \u03bb\u2081.\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for d\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (\u03bb\u2082 / \u03bb\u2081)\n\nSubstitute the given values for \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (500 / 600)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nd\u2082 = d\u2081 * (5 / 6)\n\nSo the answer is that d\u2082, the reconstructed image distance, is equal to (5/6) the object distance d\u2081.\n\n Solution: F\n\nIn summary, the reconstructed image distance is (5/6) the object distance. This is because the image distance is scaled by the ratio of the reconstruction wavelength to the original wavelength. This solution provides a clear understanding of the relationship between object distance, image distance, and wavelengths in holography.\n\nNo further changes are needed.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nSolution: F"
