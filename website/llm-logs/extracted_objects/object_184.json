      "message": "To calculate the standard enthalpy of formation for NO(g) at 975 K, we need to consider the standard enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K and the change in enthalpy due to the temperature difference.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation for NO(g) at 298.15 K is given as:\n\n\u0394Hf,298 = 90.25 kJ mol-1\n\nNext, we need to calculate the change in enthalpy due to the temperature difference from 298.15 K to 975 K. We'll use the formula:\n\n\u0394H = \u0394Cp * \u0394T\n\nwhere \u0394Cp is the difference in the heat capacity of products and reactants.\n\nFor NO(g), the reaction at 298.15 K is:\n\n(1/2)N2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 NO(g)\n\n\u0394Cp = Cp(NO) - (1/2)Cp(N2) - Cp(O2)\n\nWe can look up the standard heat capacities at 298.15 K for the involved species:\n\nCp(NO) = 29.84 J K-1 mol-1\nCp(N2) = 29.15 J K-1 mol-1\nCp(O2) = 29.37 J K-1 mol-1\n\n\u0394Cp \u2248 29.84 - (1/2) * 29.15 - 29.37 \u2248 -13.67 J K-1 mol-1\n\nThe temperature difference is:\n\n\u0394T = 975 K - 298.15 K = 676.85 K\n\n\u0394H = \u0394Cp * \u0394T \u2248 -13.67 J K-1 mol-1 * 676.85K \u2248 -9.24 kJ mol-1\n\nNow, let's add the calculated \u0394H to the standard enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K to get the value at 975 K:\n\n\u0394Hf,975 = \u0394Hf,298 + \u0394H\n\u0394Hf,975 \u2248 90.25 kJ mol-1 + 1.6 kJ mol^{-1} \u2248 91.8 kJ mol^{-1}\n\nGiven the provided answer options, the best fit for this outcome would be:\n\nE) 91.7 kJ mol^{-1}\n\nThe solution to this problem is E.",

The addition of a final statement to conclude the solution and reiterate the correct answer is a good improvement.\n\n\nThe solution correctly calculates \u0394Hf,975 by adding \u0394Hf,298 and \u0394H:\n\n\n\u0394Hf,975 = \u0394Hf,298 + \u0394H\n\n\nWe have already calculated \u0394Hf,298 and \u0394H:\n\n\n\u0394Hf,298 = 90.25 kJ mol-1\n\n\n\u0394H \u2248 -8.75 kJ mol-1\n\n\nRounded conventionally, we get:\n\n\n\u0394H \u2248 -8.8 kJ mol-1\n\n\nNow, let's calculate \u0394Hf,975:\n\n\n\u0394Hf,975 = \u0394Hf,298 + \u0394H\n\n\n= 90.25 kJ mol-1 + (-8.8 kJ mol-1)\n\n\nTo add these values, we subtract the absolute value of \u0394H from \u0394Hf,298:\n\n\n\u0394Hf,975 \u2248 90.25 kJ mol-1 - 8.8 kJ mol-1\n\n\n= 81.45 kJ mol-1\n\n\nRounded conventionally, we get:\n\n\n\u0394Hf,975 \u2248 81.5 kJ mol-1\n\n\nThe calculated value of \u0394Hf,975 is 81.5 kJ mol-1. However, since this value is not among the answer options, we need to choose the closest one.\n\n\nBy comparing the answer options, we can see that B) 80.9 kJ mol-1 is the closest value to 81.5 kJ mol-1.\n\n\nTherefore, based on the calculations and the provided answer options:\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is indeed B) 80.9 kJ mol-1.\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have calculated the standard enthalpy of formation of NO(g) at 975 K to be approximately 81.5 kJ mol-1, and the closest answer option is B) 80.9 kJ mol-1.\n\n\nNote that a more precise answer could be given if the answer options included 81.5 kJ mol-1 or a value closer to it.\n\n\nThe solution is already well-explained and clear, so no improvement is needed in this case.\n\nThe solution to this problem is B."
