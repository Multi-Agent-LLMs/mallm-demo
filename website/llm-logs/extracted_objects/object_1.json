The shot clock is a timer designed to increase scoring by preventing teams from stalling the game.\n\nAccording to the NBA rulebook, the shot clock is set to 24 seconds. This means that the offense must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. If they fail to do so, the ball is turned over to the opposing team.\n\nWith this in mind, let's look at the options provided. We can see that option E) 24 seconds matches the NBA shot clock rule.\n\nThe solution is E."

The shot clock is a timer designed to increase scoring by preventing teams from stalling the game.\n\nAccording to the NBA rulebook, the shot clock is set to 24 seconds. This means that the offense must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. If they fail to do so, the ball is turned over to the opposing team.\n\nWith this in mind, let's look at the options provided. We can see that option E) 24 seconds matches the NBA shot clock rule.\n\nThe solution is E."

This means that the offense must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.

The shot clock is a timer designed to increase scoring by preventing teams from stalling the game.\n\nAccording to the NBA rulebook, the shot clock is set to 24 seconds. This means that the offense must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. If they fail to do so, the ball is turned over to the opposing team.\n\nWith this in mind, let's look at the options provided. We can see that option E) 24 seconds matches the NBA shot clock rule.\n\nThe solution is E."

The shot clock is a timer designed to increase scoring by preventing teams from stalling the game.\n\nAccording to the NBA rulebook, the shot clock is set to 24 seconds. This means that the offense must attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. If they fail to do so, the ball is turned over to the opposing team.\n\nWith this in mind, let's look at the options provided. We can see that option E) 24 seconds matches the NBA shot clock rule.\n\nThe solution is E."
