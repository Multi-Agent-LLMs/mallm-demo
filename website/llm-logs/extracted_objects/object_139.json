      "message": "To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to first calculate the subtotal of all their expenses.

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05",

In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

It is more precise to maintain exact calculations and round only at the final step where necessary.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\n1. Calculate the subtotal of all their expenses:\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\n2. Calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal) using exact decimal conversion:\n3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid. Maintain the sales tax in its exact decimal form and round the final answer if necessary.\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount = $16.55 + $0.4965\nTotal amount = $17.0465\n\nRounded to two decimal places for practical payment purposes:\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nMoreover, to verify if separate checks would make a difference, let's calculate the total amount they would pay with separate checks:\n\nMeal 1: $6.75 + (3% of $6.75) = $6.75 + ($6.75 * 0.03) = $6.75 + $0.2025 = $6.9525\nMeal 2: $5.50 + (3% of $5.50) = $5.50 + ($5.50 * 0.03) = $5.50 + $0.165 = $5.665\nMeal 3: $2.35 + (3% of $2.35) = $2.35 + ($2.35 * 0.03) = $2.35 + $0.0705 = $2.4205\nMeal 4: $1.95 + (3% of $1.95) = $1.95 + ($1.95 * 0.03) = $1.95 + $0.0585 = $2.0085\n\nTotal amount for separate checks = $6.9525 + $5.665 + $2.4205 + $2.0085 = $17.0465\n\nThis confirms that the total amount is the same whether they use one check or separate checks. Both scenarios result in exactly $17.05 when rounded to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is indeed G) $17.05."

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Also, it verifies the total amount when using separate checks and confirms that the result is the same as using a single check.\n\nTo rephrase and further detail the solution:\n\nAs the Restaurant Manager, I agree with the Accountant's analysis. To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to calculate the subtotal of all their expenses.\n\n1. Calculate the subtotal:\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\n2. Calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal) using exact decimal conversion:\n3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid. Maintain the sales tax in its exact decimal form and round the final answer if necessary.\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount = $16.55 + $0.4965\nTotal amount = $17.0465\n\nRounded to two decimal places for practical payment purposes:\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nFor separate checks, we need to calculate the total amount they would pay for each meal, including sales tax, and then add these amounts together:\n\nMeal 1: $6.75 + (3% of $6.75) = $6.75 + ($6.75 * 0.03) = $6.75 + $0.2025 = $6.9525\nMeal 2: $5.50 + (3% of $5.50) = $5.50 + ($5.50 * 0.03) = $5.50 + $0.165 = $5.665\nMeal 3: $2.35 + (3% of $2.35) = $2.35 + ($2.35 * 0.03) = $2.35 + $0.0705 = $2.4205\nMeal 4: $1.95 + (3% of $1.95) = $1.95 + ($1.95 * 0.03) = $1.95 + $0.0585 = $2.0085\n\nTotal amount for separate checks = $6.9525 + $5.665 + $2.4205 + $2.0085 = $17.0465\n\nBoth scenarios result in exactly $17.05 when rounded to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is indeed G) $17.05."

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05",

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

              "content": "Math Tutor: To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to first calculate the subtotal of all their expenses. Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

              "content": "Math Tutor: To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to first calculate the subtotal of all their expenses. Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

It maintains the exact sales tax calculation and rounds only at the final step. Also, it verifies the total amount when using separate checks and confirms that the result is the same as using a single check.\n\nTo rephrase and further detail the solution:\n\nAs the Restaurant Manager, I agree with the Accountant's analysis. To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to calculate the subtotal of all their expenses.\n\n1. Calculate the subtotal:\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\n2. Calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal) using exact decimal conversion:\n3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid. Maintain the sales tax in its exact decimal form and round the final answer if necessary.\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount = $16.55 + $0.4965\nTotal amount = $17.0465\n\nRounded to two decimal places for practical payment purposes:\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nFor separate checks, we need to calculate the total amount they would pay for each meal, including sales tax, and then add these amounts together:\n\nMeal 1: $6.75 + (3% of $6.75) = $6.75 + ($6.75 * 0.03) = $6.75 + $0.2025 = $6.9525\nMeal 2: $5.50 + (3% of $5.50) = $5.50 + ($5.50 * 0.03) = $5.50 + $0.165 = $5.665\nMeal 3: $2.35 + (3% of $2.35) = $2.35 + ($2.35 * 0.03) = $2.35 + $0.0705 = $2.4205\nMeal 4: $1.95 + (3% of $1.95) = $1.95 + ($1.95 * 0.03) = $1.95 + $0.0585 = $2.0085\n\nTotal amount for separate checks = $6.9525 + $5.665 + $2.4205 + $2.0085 = $17.0465\n\nBoth scenarios result in exactly $17.05 when rounded to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is indeed G) $17.05."

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Their approach is step-by-step, logically sound, and unambiguous, ensuring accurate calculations and considering both single-check and separate-check scenarios.\n\nThe solution condenses repetitive statements, provides a clearer and more concise final answer, and includes an important note about maintaining exact calculations throughout the process. This addition helps to minimize rounding errors and ensures accuracy in similar problems.\n\nThe solution provides a detailed breakdown of the calculations, addresses the additional consideration of separate checks, and effectively communicates the necessary steps to solve the problem.\n\nI do not see any need for further improvements, as the current improved solution already demonstrates the most effective approach to solving this problem.\n\nThe suggestion made by the Accountant to add a flowchart or diagram to illustrate the calculation steps is a good idea, but it is not necessary to improve the solution.

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal) using exact decimal conversion:\n3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid. Maintain the sales tax in its exact decimal form and round the final answer if necessary.\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount = $16.55 + $0.4965\nTotal amount = $17.0465\n\nRounded to two decimal places for practical payment purposes:\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nFor separate checks, we need to calculate the total amount they would pay for each meal, including sales tax, and then add these amounts together:\n\nMeal 1: $6.75 + (3% of $6.75) = $6.75 + ($6.75 * 0.03) = $6.75 + $0.2025 = $6.9525\nMeal 2: $5.50 + (3% of $5.50) = $5.50 + ($5.50 * 0.03) = $5.50 + $0.165 = $5.665\nMeal 3: $2.35 + (3% of $2.35) = $2.35 + ($2.35 * 0.03) = $2.35 + $0.0705 = $2.4205\nMeal 4: $1.95 + (3% of $1.95) = $1.95 + ($1.95 * 0.03) = $1.95 + $0.0585 = $2.0085\n\nTotal amount for separate checks = $6.9525 + $5.665 + $2.4205 + $2.0085 = $17.0465\n\nBoth scenarios result in exactly $17.05 when rounded to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is indeed G) $17.05."

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal) using exact decimal conversion:\n3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid. Maintain the sales tax in its exact decimal form and round the final answer if necessary.\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount = $16.55 + $0.4965\nTotal amount = $17.0465\n\nRounded to two decimal places for practical payment purposes:\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nFor separate checks, we need to calculate the total amount they would pay for each meal, including sales tax, and then add these amounts together:\n\nMeal 1: $6.75 + (3% of $6.75) = $6.75 + ($6.75 * 0.03) = $6.75 + $0.2025 = $6.9525\nMeal 2: $5.50 + (3% of $5.50) = $5.50 + ($5.50 * 0.03) = $5.50 + $0.165 = $5.665\nMeal 3: $2.35 + (3% of $2.35) = $2.35 + ($2.35 * 0.03) = $2.35 + $0.0705 = $2.4205\nMeal 4: $1.95 + (3% of $1.95) = $1.95 + ($1.95 * 0.03) = $1.95 + $0.0585 = $2.0085\n\nTotal amount for separate checks = $6.9525 + $5.665 + $2.4205 + $2.0085 = $17.0465\n\nBoth scenarios result in exactly $17.05 when rounded to two decimal places for practical purposes.\n\nSolution: The correct answer is indeed G) $17.05."

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

              "content": "Math Tutor: To find the total amount John Cowan and his family paid, we need to first calculate the subtotal of all their expenses. Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"

Let's add the amounts they spent on meals:\n\n$6.75 + $5.50 = $12.25\n$12.25 + $2.35 = $14.60\n$14.60 + $1.95 = $16.55\n\nNow that we have the subtotal, we need to calculate the sales tax (3% of the subtotal). \n\nTo calculate 3% of $16.55, we'll convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 (3% = 3 \u00f7 100 = 0.03).\n\nSales tax = $16.55 * 0.03\nSales tax = $0.4965\n\nSince we can't pay fractions of a cent, we round the sales tax to two decimal places.\nSales tax \u2248 $0.50\n\nNow we add the sales tax to the subtotal to find the total amount they paid.\n\nTotal amount = Subtotal + Sales tax\nTotal amount \u2248 $16.55 + $0.50\nTotal amount \u2248 $17.05\n\nHowever, since the sales tax may not always round up to exactly $0.50, it is good to have exact, not approximate, calculations for such tasks. In this task for providing the answer, the solution to should show the total as exactly $17.05.\n\nIn terms of whether or not they would pay more with separate checks, when they use one check for their meals, they have to pay 3% of the sum.  In the case that each check is for each meal separately, they pay (3% * $6.75) + (3% * $5.50) + (3% * $2.35) + (3% * $1.95). It would also be approximately $17.05. Since there isn't any other option with a more favorable total than exactly $17.05, I can conclude that there isn't any other option should show any higher totals since these two will always produce identical results.  \n\nSolution: The correct answer is (G) $17.05"
