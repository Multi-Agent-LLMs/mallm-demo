Actors convinced their actions harm nobody - This corresponds to the \"Denial of injury\" strategy, which means the actor minimizes or denies the harm caused by their actions.\n2. Actors argue their norm violation is an attempt to realize higher-order values - This corresponds to \"Appeal to higher loyalties,\" where the actor justifies their actions by claiming they serve a higher moral or ethical goal.\n3. Actors argue they are owed something - This corresponds to the \"Metaphor of the ledger\" strategy, where the actor uses the idea of reciprocity and claims that their actions are justified because they feel they are owed something.\n\nNow, we match the descriptions with the given options.\n\nA) Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger, Denial of injury - Incorrect sequence\nB) Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties - Correct sequence\nC) Denial of injury, Metaphor of the balance, Appeal to higher loyalties - \"Metaphor of the balance\" is not mentioned in the descriptions.\nD) Metaphor of the ledger, Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties - Incorrect sequence\nE) Denial of responsibility, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties - \"Denial of responsibility\" is not mentioned in the descriptions.\nF) Appeal to higher loyalties, Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger - Incorrect sequence\nG) Denial of victim, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger - \"Denial of victim\" is similar but not the exact term used in the descriptions.\nH) Appeal to higher loyalties, Denial of responsibility, Metaphor of the ledger - \"Denial of responsibility\" is not mentioned in the descriptions.\nI) Metaphor of the ledger, Denial of victim, Appeal to higher loyalties - \"Denial of victim\" is similar but not the exact term used in the descriptions.\nJ) Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger - Incorrect sequence\n\nCorrect answer: B) Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties"

The analysis and discussion provided by the Business Ethics Professor, the Organizational Behavior Specialist, and the Criminologist confirm that the correct sequence of strategies used to justify or deny unethical behavior is indeed:\n\n1. Actors convinced their actions harm nobody - \"Denial of injury\" (minimizing or denying the harm caused by their actions)\n2. Actors argue they are owed something - \"Metaphor of the ledger\" (using the idea of reciprocity and claiming that their actions are justified because they feel they are owed something)\n3. Actors argue their norm violation is an attempt to realize higher-order values - \"Appeal to higher loyalties\" (justifying their actions by claiming they serve a higher moral or ethical goal)\n\nThe improved solution explicitly includes the letter corresponding to the answer:\n\nSolution: B) Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement by providing a clear and concise final answer.\n\nFinal Solution: B\n\nExplanation: The correct sequence of strategies used to justify or deny unethical behavior is Denial of injury, Metaphor of the ledger, Appeal to higher loyalties, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThis solution is clear, concise, and accurately represents the correct sequence of strategies used to justify or deny unethical behavior.
