The mass ratio is correctly used to set up a proportion to find the amount of oxygen required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\n\nThe calculation for the amount of oxygen required is also correct:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nThe solution concludes that 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen, which corresponds to answer option C.

The solution carefully outlines the steps to solve the problem and accurately calculates the amount of oxygen required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\n\nHowever, I can provide some additional explanations and minor improvements to the solution for clarity and completeness.\n\nStep 1: \nThe atomic masses are approximately: phosphorus (P) = 31 g/mol and oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol. These values are widely accepted and used in chemistry calculations.\n\nStep 2: \nThe given atomic ratio of phosphorus to oxygen is 2:5, meaning 2 atoms of phosphorus react with 5 atoms of oxygen. This information is crucial in determining the mass ratio.\n\nStep 3: \nNow we calculate the mass ratio using the atomic masses.\n2 atoms of phosphorus correspond to 2 * 31 g = 62 g\n5 atoms of oxygen correspond to 5 * 16 g = 80 g\nTherefore, the mass ratio of P to O is 62:80 or simplified to 31:40. This simplification is accurate and will be used to determine the required mass of oxygen.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we will use the mass ratio to find out how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\nWe know 31 g of phosphorus is required for 40 g of oxygen, so we set up the proportion:\n(31 g of P / 40 g of O) = (3.10 g of P / X g of O)\nWhere X represents the amount of oxygen required.\nNow we solve for X:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nAlternatively, we can express this calculation as:\nMass of oxygen required = (Mass of phosphorus) * (mass ratio of oxygen to phosphorus)\nMass of oxygen required = 3.10 g P * (40 g O / 31 g P)\nMass of oxygen required = 4.00 g of O\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, but the second expression might be more intuitive for some users.\n\nImproved Solution:\nThe answer is C, since 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen.\n\nThis solution is accurate and follows the proper steps to determine the required mass of oxygen.

The solution carefully outlines the steps to solve the problem and accurately calculates the amount of oxygen required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\n\nHowever, I can provide some additional explanations and minor improvements to the solution for clarity and completeness.\n\nStep 1: \nThe atomic masses are approximately: phosphorus (P) = 31 g/mol and oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol. These values are widely accepted and used in chemistry calculations.\n\nStep 2: \nThe given atomic ratio of phosphorus to oxygen is 2:5, meaning 2 atoms of phosphorus react with 5 atoms of oxygen.

This information is crucial in determining the mass ratio.\n\nStep 3: \nNow we calculate the mass ratio using the atomic masses.\n2 atoms of phosphorus correspond to 2 * 31 g = 62 g\n5 atoms of oxygen correspond to 5 * 16 g = 80 g\nTherefore, the mass ratio of P to O is 62:80 or simplified to 31:40. This simplification is accurate and will be used to determine the required mass of oxygen.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we will use the mass ratio to find out how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\nWe know 31 g of phosphorus is required for 40 g of oxygen, so we set up the proportion:\n(31 g of P / 40 g of O) = (3.10 g of P / X g of O)\nWhere X represents the amount of oxygen required.\nNow we solve for X:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nAlternatively, we can express this calculation as:\nMass of oxygen required = (Mass of phosphorus) * (mass ratio of oxygen to phosphorus)\nMass of oxygen required = 3.10 g P * (40 g O / 31 g P)\nMass of oxygen required = 4.00 g of O\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, but the second expression might be more intuitive for some users.\n\nImproved Solution:\nThe answer is C, since 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen.\n\nThis solution is accurate and follows the proper steps to determine the required mass of oxygen. Therefore, I agree with the current solution."

This simplification is accurate and will be used to determine the required mass of oxygen.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we will use the mass ratio to find out how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\nWe know 31 g of phosphorus is required for 40 g of oxygen, so we set up the proportion:\n(31 g of P / 40 g of O) = (3.10 g of P / X g of O)\nWhere X represents the amount of oxygen required.\nNow we solve for X:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nAlternatively, we can express this calculation as:\nMass of oxygen required = (Mass of phosphorus) * (mass ratio of oxygen to phosphorus)\nMass of oxygen required = 3.10 g P * (40 g O / 31 g P)\nMass of oxygen required = 4.00 g of O\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, but the second expression might be more intuitive for some users.\n\nImproved Solution:\nThe answer is C, since 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen.\n\nThis solution is accurate and follows the proper steps to determine the required mass of oxygen.

This simplification is accurate and will be used to determine the required mass of oxygen.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we will use the mass ratio to find out how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\nWe know 31 g of phosphorus is required for 40 g of oxygen, so we set up the proportion:\n(31 g of P / 40 g of O) = (3.10 g of P / X g of O)\nWhere X represents the amount of oxygen required.\nNow we solve for X:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nAlternatively, we can express this calculation as:\nMass of oxygen required = (Mass of phosphorus) * (mass ratio of oxygen to phosphorus)\nMass of oxygen required = 3.10 g P * (40 g O / 31 g P)\nMass of oxygen required = 4.00 g of O\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, but the second expression might be more intuitive for some users.\n\nImproved Solution:\nThe answer is C, since 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen.\n\nThis solution is accurate and follows the proper steps to determine the required mass of oxygen. Therefore, I agree with the current solution."

These values are widely accepted and used in chemistry calculations.\n\nStep 2: \nThe given atomic ratio of phosphorus to oxygen is 2:5, meaning 2 atoms of phosphorus react with 5 atoms of oxygen.

This simplification is accurate and will be used to determine the required mass of oxygen.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we will use the mass ratio to find out how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus.\nWe know 31 g of phosphorus is required for 40 g of oxygen, so we set up the proportion:\n(31 g of P / 40 g of O) = (3.10 g of P / X g of O)\nWhere X represents the amount of oxygen required.\nNow we solve for X:\nX = 40 g of O * (3.10 g of P / 31 g of P)\n  = 4.00 g of O\n\nAlternatively, we can express this calculation as:\nMass of oxygen required = (Mass of phosphorus) * (mass ratio of oxygen to phosphorus)\nMass of oxygen required = 3.10 g P * (40 g O / 31 g P)\nMass of oxygen required = 4.00 g of O\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, but the second expression might be more intuitive for some users.\n\nImproved Solution:\nThe answer is C, since 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen.\n\nThis solution is accurate and follows the proper steps to determine the required mass of oxygen. Therefore, I agree with the current solution."

Therefore, 3.10 g of phosphorus indeed requires 4.00 g of oxygen, which corresponds to answer option C.\n\nThis refined solution is minor, but it removes the unnecessary calculation of the mass ratio in Step 2 and directly uses the simplified mass ratio of 31:40.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that the current solution is already clear and concise, and my revision is only a minor improvement. The core solution remains the same, and the conclusion that 3.10 g of phosphorus requires 4.00 g of oxygen, corresponding to answer option C, remains accurate.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the revised solution, and the final answer is indeed C.\n\nFinal Solution:\nThe answer is C."
