Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used).

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE. Thus, the correct option is the one corresponding to this combination.\n\nSolution: B"

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE. Thus, the correct option is the one corresponding to this combination.\n\nSolution: B"

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used).

This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE. Thus, the correct option is the one corresponding to this combination.\n\nSolution: B"

This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used).

This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.

Statement 1: \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\"\n   - As a Computer Vision researcher, I can confirm that ImageNet indeed contains images of various resolutions. This dataset is a large collection of images, and the images themselves can vary significantly in resolution due to differences in the sources from which the images are obtained. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.\n\n2. Statement 2: \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\"\n   - To verify this statement, we need to know the typical size of both datasets. As of my last update, ImageNet contains more than 14 million images, whereas Caltech-101 contains about 9,000 images (with some variations in the number depending on the specific subset or version used). This clearly shows that Caltech-101 has significantly fewer images than ImageNet. Therefore, this statement is FALSE.\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that Statement 1 is TRUE and Statement 2 is FALSE.
