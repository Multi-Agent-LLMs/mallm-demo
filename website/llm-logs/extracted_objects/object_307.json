The explanation for both statements clearly justifies the conclusions using fundamental principles of group theory.\n\nStatement 1 is correctly analyzed with the consideration of the necessary condition for HK to be a subgroup of G, and the connection to Lagrange's theorem is aptly mentioned. Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here.

Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

            "content": "To solve this task, let's analyze each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|.\n\nWe know from the definition of the product of two subsets in a group that if H and K are subgroups of G, then HK is also a subset of G. For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

The explanation for both statements clearly justifies the conclusions using fundamental principles of group theory.\n\nStatement 1 is correctly analyzed with the consideration of the necessary condition for HK to be a subgroup of G, and the connection to Lagrange's theorem is aptly mentioned. Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3).

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

The explanation for both statements clearly justifies the conclusions using fundamental principles of group theory.\n\nStatement 1 is correctly analyzed with the consideration of the necessary condition for HK to be a subgroup of G, and the connection to Lagrange's theorem is aptly mentioned. Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True.",

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH.

When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.

Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3).

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

The connections to relevant theorems, such as Cauchy's theorem, and the principle of inclusion-exclusion in combinatorics are well-established and accurately applied.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\nB) True, True.\n\nExplanation: \n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. This condition ensures that HK is closed under the group operation and contains the necessary inverses and identities. When HK = KH, the formula |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| is a direct result of applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion in combinatorics to the subgroups H and K.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p, supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups.

In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p.

For HK to be a subgroup, it's necessary that HK = KH (a property that might not always be satisfied for any subgroups H and K).\n\nHowever, there is a more fundamental issue here. The size formula seems to resemble the product rule for the sizes of sets (also known as the multiplication principle in combinatorics), but with an important twist due to the nature of groups. Still, considering our case, when H and K are subgroups, it does apply under specific conditions.\n\nStatement 1 is supported by principles closely related to Lagrange's theorem, but the formula can only be applicable when HK also forms a subgroup of G (which could be the case but is not directly stated). So generally it holds but requires this condition.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nTo evaluate this statement, we should consider possible group structures of order 2p, where p is an odd prime.\n\nFor any such group, there will be an element of order p (due to Cauchy's theorem in group theory, which assures us of an element of order p), and we can consider the possible cases of elements of order 2.\n\nWhen combining these elements of order 2 and p, we reach a classification:\n\n- The cyclic group (when the element of order 2 generates a subgroup that normalizes the subgroup generated by the element of order p).\n- The dihedral group D_p (which can actually only be the case if p is odd).\n\nTherefore, the classification given is correct for groups of order 2p with p an odd prime.\n\nSo the correct answer to our task would be B) True, True."

However, as the professor notes, this condition can be satisfied under certain circumstances.\n\nFor Statement 2, the professor provides a clear classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem and the properties of dihedral groups.\n\nThe professor's conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True."

The explanation for both statements clearly justifies the conclusions using fundamental principles of group theory.\n\nStatement 1 is correctly analyzed with the consideration of the necessary condition for HK to be a subgroup of G, and the connection to Lagrange's theorem is aptly mentioned. Although the statement might seem generally true in many contexts, its applicability is conditional upon HK being a subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is accurately analyzed with a clear and concise classification of groups of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, into cyclic groups and dihedral groups D_p. The use of Cauchy's theorem to justify the existence of elements of order p is appropriate, and the distinction between cyclic and dihedral groups based on the interaction of elements of order 2 and p is correctly made.\n\nThe conclusion that both statements are true is well-supported by the explanations provided, and therefore, the correct answer is indeed B) True, True.\n\nHowever, for the sake of completeness, it might be beneficial to explicitly state the conditions under which |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| holds true and provide an example or a reference for groups of order 2p that are isomorphic to either cyclic or dihedral groups. But these are minor enhancements rather than fundamental disagreements.\n\nImproved Solution with Enhanced Explanations:\n\nStatement 1 | If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K|. This statement is true under the condition that HK is a subgroup of G, which is satisfied when HK = KH. In general, the formula resembles the principle of inclusion-exclusion or the product rule in combinatorics but applies to groups under specific conditions.\n\nFor instance, consider the product of the subgroups in the context of Sylow's theorem or the symmetric group. When the conditions are met, the formula holds true.\n\nStatement 2 | A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p. This classification is supported by Cauchy's theorem, which guarantees the existence of an element of order p in any such group. Combining this element with the properties of an element of order 2 leads to the conclusion that the group must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nConsider examples like p = 3 where the group could be isomorphic to the cyclic group C_6 or the dihedral group D_3 (which is actually S_3). For larger p, these patterns and classifications hold true.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer remains: B) True, True."
