      "message": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of freezing-point depression, which is related to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded",

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf).

The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

At 25\u00b0C the \u0394T = 25 - 0 for water; 200 - \u0394T - \u0394T = 25 for sucrose. \u0394T of sucrose is 200 - 25 - \u0394T or 175 - \u0394T - \u0394T = 25 - 25; 175 - 2\u0394T = 0.\n\nThus 2\u0394T = 175 - 0.\n\u0394T of sucrose = 175 / 2 = 87.5 K\n\nHowever we cannot use this \u0394T as the freezing point has been already depressed to -9.46 which being considered; taking the \u0394T as 9.46 at 25; 200 -9.46 \n\n\u0394T = 25 - (-9.46) = 25 + 9.46\n\n\u0394T = 34.46 K \n\nthus \n25 - (-9.46) =  unit two freezing points - \n\nthus \nKf for sucrose * 6.2 molal \u2248 34.46 \nthus \nKf \u224834.46 /6.2 \nKf \u22485.56\n\n\n\nthus \n \u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (5.56 K/m)\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 4005 / 342] \n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 4005/342 *342\n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 11.69 *342\n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 4005"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol).

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

At 25\u00b0C the \u0394T = 25 - 0 for water; 200 - \u0394T - \u0394T = 25 for sucrose. \u0394T of sucrose is 200 - 25 - \u0394T or 175 - \u0394T - \u0394T = 25 - 25; 175 - 2\u0394T = 0.\n\nThus 2\u0394T = 175 - 0.\n\u0394T of sucrose = 175 / 2 = 87.5 K\n\nHowever we cannot use this \u0394T as the freezing point has been already depressed to -9.46 which being considered; taking the \u0394T as 9.46 at 25; 200 -9.46 \n\n\u0394T = 25 - (-9.46) = 25 + 9.46\n\n\u0394T = 34.46 K \n\nthus \n25 - (-9.46) =  unit two freezing points - \n\nthus \nKf for sucrose * 6.2 molal \u2248 34.46 \nthus \nKf \u224834.46 /6.2 \nKf \u22485.56\n\n\n\nthus \n \u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (5.56 K/m)\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 4005 / 342] \n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 4005/342 *342\n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 11.69 *342\n thus \u0394HfSucrose = 4005"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"

The formula for freezing-point depression is:\n\n\u0394T = Kf * m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solution.\n\nWe are given the molality of the sucrose solution (6.2 molal) and the molecular weight of sucrose (342 g/mol). We are also given the melting point of sucrose (200\u00b0C), but we are not given the cryoscopic constant directly.\n\nHowever, we can use the given heat of fusion of water (1400 cal/mole) to relate it to the cryoscopic constant (Kf). The cryoscopic constant (Kf) is related to the heat of fusion by the following equation:\n\nKf = RT\u00b2 / \u0394Hf\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/mol*K), T is the melting point of the solvent (in Kelvin), and \u0394Hf is the heat of fusion.\n\nFor water, the melting point is 0\u00b0C or 273 K.\n\nKf_water = (1.987 cal/mol*K * (273 K)\u00b2) / (1400 cal/mole) \u2248 1.86 K/m \n\nSince we know that the solubility of sucrose in water is 6.2 molal at 25\u00b0C, the freezing point depression \u0394T =  Kf_water * 6.2 mol \u2248 11.49 K \n\nNow for sucrose,\n \n...[\u0394T] =  Kf * 6.2 m \n(f milling point 200\u00b0C)...Kf for sucrose * 6.2 \u2248 11.49 \nThus 6.2 Kf \u2248 11.49 \n\nKf \u2248 1.85 K/ m\n\nThe heat of fusion can now be calculated for sucrose from \n...[\u0394Hf = RT\u00b2 / Kf] \n\n\u0394HfSucrose \u2248 (1.987 cal/mol*K * (473 K)\u00b2) / (1.85 K/m)\n\n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555.4686 / 342] \u2248 10402 \n\napproximating no. \n...[\u0394Hf \u2248 3555 ] rounded to milling point 11 places answer rounded"
