Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0",

The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL.

The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The calculations are accurate, and rounding to the nearest provided answer is reasonable given the precision of the options.\n\nThe minor improvement suggested by the Analytical Chemist is also helpful, as it clarifies that the result is an approximation.\n\nThere is no need for further improvements, as the current solution is clear, concise, and accurate.\n\nHowever, for the sake of clarity, I can reiterate the solution in my own words:\n\nTo find the observed rotation, we use the formula for specific rotation, which is given by:\n\n[\u03b1]^T_D = (\u03b1) / (c \u00d7 l)\n\nGiven the specific rotation [\u03b1]^25_D of L-alanine as +1.8, we rearrange the formula to solve for \u03b1:\n\n\u03b1 = [\u03b1]^25_D \u00d7 c \u00d7 l\n\nWe are given a 1.10 M solution, but the concentration needs to be in g/mL to match the units of the formula. The molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\u00b0\n\nRounded to the nearest provided answer, the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The calculations are accurate, and rounding to the nearest provided answer is reasonable given the precision of the options.\n\nThe minor improvement suggested by the Analytical Chemist is also helpful, as it clarifies that the result is an approximation.\n\nThere is no need for further improvements, as the current solution is clear, concise, and accurate.\n\nHowever, for the sake of clarity, I can reiterate the solution in my own words:\n\nTo find the observed rotation, we use the formula for specific rotation, which is given by:\n\n[\u03b1]^T_D = (\u03b1) / (c \u00d7 l)\n\nGiven the specific rotation [\u03b1]^25_D of L-alanine as +1.8, we rearrange the formula to solve for \u03b1:\n\n\u03b1 = [\u03b1]^25_D \u00d7 c \u00d7 l\n\nWe are given a 1.10 M solution, but the concentration needs to be in g/mL to match the units of the formula. The molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\u00b0\n\nRounded to the nearest provided answer, the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\u00b0\n\nRounded to the nearest provided answer, the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol.\n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\u00b0\n\nRounded to the nearest provided answer, the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"

The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL.

The specific rotation is already in the correct units for the D-line at 25\u00b0C. The length is given as 2.5 dm, which is correct for the formula. The issue here is the concentration needs to be in g/mL. Since we have a 1.10 M solution, we'll need to calculate the concentration in g/mL to proceed.\n\nThe molecular weight of L-alanine is approximately 89.09 g/mol. \n\nFirst, calculate the mass of 1 L of 1.10 M L-alanine:\n1.10 mol/L * 89.09 g/mol = 98 g/L\n\nNow, convert to g/mL (1 L = 1000 mL):\n98 g/L / 1000 mL/L = 0.098 g/mL\n\nNow, calculate the observed rotation (remember, [\u03b1]^25_D = +1.8, c = 0.098 g/mL, and l = 2.5 dm):\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00b0 \u00d7 (0.098 g/mL) \u00d7 2.5 dm\n\u03b1 = +1.8 \u00d7 0.245\n\u03b1 \u2248 0.441\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest provided answer (though it's slightly off from exact calculations due to precision), the observed rotation is approximately 0.44\u00b0.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE) 0.44\u00b0"
