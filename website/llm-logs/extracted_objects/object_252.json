So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria.

Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria.

Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria.

Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect.

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"

So, this option doesn't clearly distinguish them.\n\nB) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei: This option is a key characteristic of cyanobacteria. They are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, unlike eukaryotic green algae.\n\nC) Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds: This statement is incorrect. Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds. Some cyanobacteria are well-known for nitrogen fixation, but stating that green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds doesn't accurately highlight a fundamental difference.\n\nD) Green algae cannot photosynthesize: This is incorrect. Green algae can photosynthesize and, in fact, use chlorophyll for this process, just like cyanobacteria.\n\nE) Green algae produce cell membranes: While green algae do produce cell membranes, this is not a distinguishing characteristic between cyanobacteria and green algae, as both can have cell membranes.\n\nF) Green algae have no chlorophyll: This is incorrect. Green algae contain chlorophyll and use it for photosynthesis, similar to cyanobacteria.\n\nG) Cyanobacteria lack cell walls: While cyanobacteria have a peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls, it's incorrect to state they lack cell walls entirely. Also, the composition and presence of cell walls do not solely define the difference between these groups.\n\nH) Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize: While this statement is true, it doesn't differentiate cyanobacteria from green algae, as both can photosynthesize.\n\nGiven this analysis, the primary distinguishing characteristic that most accurately differentiates cyanobacteria from green unicellular algae is that cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nSolution: B"
