The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature according to the equation:\n\nk = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4T\n\nwhere T is in \u00b0F.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n Tube (Outside diameter: 3.0 in.)\n  Outside radius (r2) = 0.1458 ft\n  Inside radius (r1) = 0.0625 ft\n  Inside surface temperature (Ti) = 400\u00b0F\n  Outside surface temperature (To) = 150\u00b0F\n\nGradually-varying insulation (2 in. thick)\n\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Thermal Conductivity at Inside and Outside Surface Temperatures**\n\nThe inside surface temperature (Ti) is 400\u00b0F, and the outside surface temperature (To) is 150\u00b0F.\n\nFor Ti (400\u00b0F): k_i = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4 \u00d7 400 = 0.4 + 0.32 = 0.72 Btu/hr \u00b7 ft \u00b7 \u00b0F\n\nFor To (150\u00b0F): k_o = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4 \u00d7 150 = 0.4 + 0.12 = 0.52 Btu/hr \u00b7 ft \u00b7 \u00b0F\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Average Thermal Conductivity**\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can calculate the average temperature (T_avg) and then find the average thermal conductivity (k_avg).\n\n\u0394T = T_i - T_o = 400 - 150 = 250\u00b0F\n\nT_avg = (T_i + T_o) / 2 = (400 + 150) / 2 = 275\u00b0F\n\nk_avg = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4 \\* T_avg = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4 \u00d7 275 = 0.617 Btu/hr \u00b7 ft \u00b7 \u00b0F\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Log-Mean Radius**\n\nWe need to calculate the log-mean radius (r_lm) to apply the heat transfer equation.\n\nInside radius (r1) = 1.5 in / 2 = 0.75 in = 0.0625 ft (converted from inches)\n\nOutside radius (r2) = 3.5 in / 2 = 1.75 in = 0.1458 ft (converted from inches)\n\nr_lm = sqrt(r1 * r2) = sqrt(0.0625 * 0.1458) = 0.0906 ft \n\n**Step 4: Apply Heat Transfer Equation**\n\nWe'll use the following form of the heat transfer equation:\n\nQ = (Q1 / k_avg) \\* ln(r2/r1)\n\nwhere Q1 = 2 * 3.14 * 1 * (Ti - To) = 2 * 3.14 * 1 * 250 = 1570.48 Btu/hr\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nQ = (1570.48 / 0.617) \\* ln(0.1458/0.0625) \u2248 (1570.48 / 0.617) \\* 0.87 \u2248 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube is approximately **1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWe calculated the rate of heat loss per foot length of a tube with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material, considering the thermal conductivity's variation with temperature. Our approach used the log-mean radius and the heat transfer equation for a cylindrical object with variable thermal conductivity. The result, 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube, highlights the importance of proper insulation in reducing heat loss and improving energy efficiency in real-world applications.\n\nAnswer: I) 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nI) 1148 Btu/hr",

This summary would be helpful for readers who want a quick overview of the solution without having to read through the entire text.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement to the summary section. Instead of simply stating the final answer, the summary could provide a brief discussion of the significance of the result and any implications for real-world applications.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n**Heat Transfer through a Cylindrical Insulation**\n\nWe are given a tube of 3.0 in. outside diameter covered with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature according to the equation:\n\nk = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4T\n\nwhere T is in \u00b0F.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n...

(same as before)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube is approximately **1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn this problem, we calculated the rate of heat loss per foot length of a tube with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature, and we used the log-mean radius and the heat transfer equation for a cylindrical object with variable thermal conductivity to solve the problem. Our final answer indicates that the tube loses approximately 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of heat, which is a significant amount of energy. This result highlights the importance of proper insulation in reducing heat loss and improving energy efficiency in real-world applications.\n\nAnswer: I) 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the current solution and the suggested improvements.",

This summary would be helpful for readers who want a quick overview of the solution without having to read through the entire text.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement to the summary section. Instead of simply stating the final answer, the summary could provide a brief discussion of the significance of the result and any implications for real-world applications.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n**Heat Transfer through a Cylindrical Insulation**\n\nWe are given a tube of 3.0 in. outside diameter covered with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature according to the equation:\n\nk = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4T\n\nwhere T is in \u00b0F.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n...

(same as before)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube is approximately **1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn this problem, we calculated the rate of heat loss per foot length of a tube with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature, and we used the log-mean radius and the heat transfer equation for a cylindrical object with variable thermal conductivity to solve the problem. Our final answer indicates that the tube loses approximately 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of heat, which is a significant amount of energy. This result highlights the importance of proper insulation in reducing heat loss and improving energy efficiency in real-world applications.\n\nAnswer: I) 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the current solution and the suggested improvements.",

This summary would be helpful for readers who want a quick overview of the solution without having to read through the entire text.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest a minor improvement to the summary section. Instead of simply stating the final answer, the summary could provide a brief discussion of the significance of the result and any implications for real-world applications.\n\nHere is the improved solution:\n\n**Heat Transfer through a Cylindrical Insulation**\n\nWe are given a tube of 3.0 in. outside diameter covered with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature according to the equation:\n\nk = 0.4 + 8 \u00d7 10^-4T\n\nwhere T is in \u00b0F.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n...

(same as before)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube is approximately **1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nIn this problem, we calculated the rate of heat loss per foot length of a tube with a 2 in. thick layer of insulating material. The thermal conductivity of the material varies with temperature, and we used the log-mean radius and the heat transfer equation for a cylindrical object with variable thermal conductivity to solve the problem. Our final answer indicates that the tube loses approximately 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of heat, which is a significant amount of energy. This result highlights the importance of proper insulation in reducing heat loss and improving energy efficiency in real-world applications.\n\nAnswer: I) 1148 Btu/hr per foot length of the tube.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the current solution and the suggested improvements.",
