      "message": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The magnitude of each charge is $12 \\mathrm{nC}$, or $12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}$.\n   - The charges are both positive.\n   - The charges are placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle with an edge length of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n2. **Determine the electric field at the third vertex due to one charge:**\n   - The formula for the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge is given by $E = k\\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}$), $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being calculated.\n   - Since the charges are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the distance from either charge to the third vertex (where we're calculating the electric field) is $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3",

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out.

I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out.

I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

        "message": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The magnitude of each charge is $12 \\mathrm{nC}$, or $12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}$.\n   - The charges are both positive.\n   - The charges are placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle with an edge length of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n2. **Determine the electric field at the third vertex due to one charge:**\n   - The formula for the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge is given by $E = k\\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}$), $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being calculated.\n   - Since the charges are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the distance from either charge to the third vertex (where we're calculating the electric field) is $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3",

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

              "content": "To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The magnitude of each charge is $12 \\mathrm{nC}$, or $12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}$.\n   - The charges are both positive.\n   - The charges are placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle with an edge length of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n2. **Determine the electric field at the third vertex due to one charge:**\n   - The formula for the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge is given by $E = k\\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}$), $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being calculated.\n   - Since the charges are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the distance from either charge to the third vertex (where we're calculating the electric field) is $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

              "content": "Electromagnetism Professor: To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The magnitude of each charge is $12 \\mathrm{nC}$, or $12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}$.\n   - The charges are both positive.\n   - The charges are placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle with an edge length of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n2. **Determine the electric field at the third vertex due to one charge:**\n   - The formula for the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge is given by $E = k\\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}$), $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being calculated.\n   - Since the charges are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the distance from either charge to the third vertex (where we're calculating the electric field) is $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out.

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component.

              "content": "Electromagnetism Professor: To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - The magnitude of each charge is $12 \\mathrm{nC}$, or $12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}$.\n   - The charges are both positive.\n   - The charges are placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle with an edge length of $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n2. **Determine the electric field at the third vertex due to one charge:**\n   - The formula for the magnitude of the electric field due to a point charge is given by $E = k\\frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}$), $q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point where the electric field is being calculated.\n   - Since the charges are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the distance from either charge to the third vertex (where we're calculating the electric field) is $2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is  not among my options. I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"

We can calculate the electric field due to one charge: \n   \\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total electric field at the third vertex:**\n   - Because both charges are positive, they will create electric fields at the third vertex that are in the same direction (away from each charge and towards a point between them, but since it's an equilateral triangle, the magnitude of the fields due to each charge will be the same, and we'll combine them without needing to worry about the direction). We can simply add the magnitudes of the electric fields due to each charge to get the total electric field at the third vertex:\n   \\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times E_{\\text{one charge}} \\]\n\nNow let's do the calculations:\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times 27 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\approx 54 \\mathrm{~N / C} \\]\n\nWait, I made a mistake.

I will redo it. \n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{(2.0 \\mathrm{~m})^2} = (9 \\times 10^9 \\mathrm{~N \\cdot m^2 / C^2}) \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{C}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{one charge}} =  27 \\mathrm{~N / C}  \\]\n\nBut this is $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. In order to get  the answer from this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  at an angle of 60 degrees  to create an equilateral triangle. We need to resolve this $E_{\\text{one charge}}$  into $x$ and $y$ components. We then need to realize that the answer for $x$ components from two charges will point in opposite directions, cancelling them out. We are just left with the answer to $y$ from 2 charges.  2 x  $y$ components gives the answer. I will redo the calculation again:\n\n\nSince the $x$-components of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ will cancel each other out (since the fields due to each charge are at an angle of 60 degrees to the $x$-axis and are equal in magnitude), we only consider the $y$-component. The $y$-component of $E_{\\text{one charge}}$ is:\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = E_{\\text{one charge}} \\sin(60) \\]\n\n\\[ E_{y,\\text{one charge}} = (27 \\mathrm{~N / C})  \\cdot  \\frac{\\sqrt{3"
