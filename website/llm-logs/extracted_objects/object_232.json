      "message": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4",

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995.

This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal.

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'.

T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

            "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

            "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

        "message": "[DISAGREE]\n\nThe current solution correctly calculates the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank but fails to accurately calculate the constant level 'C' and the oscillation amplitude 'A'.\n\nLet's calculate the constant level 'C'. We know that initially, we have 50 oz of salt and 100 gal of water. Therefore, the initial concentration of salt is:\n\nInitial = 50 / 100 = 0.5 oz / gal\n\nSince we are adding water with a concentration of 1/4 oz/gal at a rate of 2 gal/min, the total amount of salt added after 't' minutes is:\n\nSalt added = 2 * (1/4) * t = 1/2 * t\n\nThe total amount of salt at any time 't' is the sum of the initial salt and the salt added:\n\nTotal salt = Initial salt + Salt added\nTotal salt = 50 + 1/2 * t\n\nSince we have 100 gal of water, the concentration 'C' at any time 't' is:\n\nC = Total salt / 100\nC = (50 + 1/2 * t) / 100\nHowever, this value is the one at the end, to compute this we compute the value of t when it's on its steady state.\nWe compute this value and we arrive at \n\nC = (50 +  0.5 )/ 100 \nC = (50.5)/100 = 0.505 \n\nThat is C = (50 +  2 *  this average)/100. This average we compute previously and we recall this average =  1/4 = 0.25 \n\nSo C is the following:\n\nC = (50 + 2 * 0.25 ) = ( 50 + 0.5 ) = 50.5 / 100\nC = 50.5/ 100 \nC = 0.505 / 2 \n\nC = 0.505 =  50/100 + 2 * 0.25 / 100  \nWe recall we have the following \n  C = 0.505/ 100 \n = (50/ 100)  + (2 * (1/4) )/ 100 \n So the value of this, we have the following\n\nSo we have C = 50/100 + ( 2 *  1/4)/ 100.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'.

T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)).

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'.

T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Therefore, the initial concentration of salt is:\n\nInitial = 50 / 100 = 0.5 oz / gal\n\nSince we are adding water with a concentration of 1/4 oz/gal at a rate of 2 gal/min, the total amount of salt added after 't' minutes is:\n\nSalt added = 2 * (1/4) * t = 1/2 * t\n\nThe total amount of salt at any time 't' is the sum of the initial salt and the salt added:\n\nTotal salt = Initial salt + Salt added\nTotal salt = 50 + 1/2 * t\n\nSince we have 100 gal of water, the concentration 'C' at any time 't' is:\n\nC = Total salt / 100\nC = (50 + 1/2 * t) / 100\nHowever, this value is the one at the end, to compute this we compute the value of t when it's on its steady state.\nWe compute this value and we arrive at \n\nC = (50 +  0.5 )/ 100 \nC = (50.5)/100 = 0.505 \n\nThat is C = (50 +  2 *  this average)/100.

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

        "message": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'.

T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995.

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Therefore, the initial concentration of salt is:\n\nInitial = 50 / 100 = 0.5 oz / gal\n\nSince we are adding water with a concentration of 1/4 oz/gal at a rate of 2 gal/min, the total amount of salt added after 't' minutes is:\n\nSalt added = 2 * (1/4) * t = 1/2 * t\n\nThe total amount of salt at any time 't' is the sum of the initial salt and the salt added:\n\nTotal salt = Initial salt + Salt added\nTotal salt = 50 + 1/2 * t\n\nSince we have 100 gal of water, the concentration 'C' at any time 't' is:\n\nC = Total salt / 100\nC = (50 + 1/2 * t) / 100\nHowever, this value is the one at the end, to compute this we compute the value of t when it's on its steady state.\nWe compute this value and we arrive at \n\nC = (50 +  0.5 )/ 100 \nC = (50.5)/100 = 0.505 \n\nThat is C = (50 +  2 *  this average)/100.

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

        "message": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'.

T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate.

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995.

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Therefore, the initial concentration of salt is:\n\nInitial = 50 / 100 = 0.5 oz / gal\n\nSince we are adding water with a concentration of 1/4 oz/gal at a rate of 2 gal/min, the total amount of salt added after 't' minutes is:\n\nSalt added = 2 * (1/4) * t = 1/2 * t\n\nThe total amount of salt at any time 't' is the sum of the initial salt and the salt added:\n\nTotal salt = Initial salt + Salt added\nTotal salt = 50 + 1/2 * t\n\nSince we have 100 gal of water, the concentration 'C' at any time 't' is:\n\nC = Total salt / 100\nC = (50 + 1/2 * t) / 100\nHowever, this value is the one at the end, to compute this we compute the value of t when it's on its steady state.\nWe compute this value and we arrive at \n\nC = (50 +  0.5 )/ 100 \nC = (50.5)/100 = 0.505 \n\nThat is C = (50 +  2 *  this average)/100.

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "Mathematical Modeler: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4). This implies that A = (1/2) * C.\n\nSince we know C = 0.24995, we can calculate the amplitude 'A':\n\nA = (1/2) * C = (1/2) * (0.24995) = 0.124975\n\nTo find the amplitude of the oscillation around the constant level C = 0.24995, we add and subtract the amplitude from C:\n\n   Max oscillation level = C + A = 0.24995 + 0.124975 \n= 0.374925\n\nMin oscillation level = C - A = 0.24995 - 0.124975 \n= 0.124975\n\nHowever, a better interpretation is that the solution oscillates between 0.374925 and 0.124975 around the point 0.24995. We know this point has an amplitude A = 0.124975 from its average concentration level."

              "content": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of a differential equation to model the salt concentration in the tank over time.\n\nStep 1: Let's denote the amount of salt in the tank at any given time t as S(t), and the salt concentration in the tank as C(t). We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

We are given that water containing a salt concentration of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 2 gal/min. \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank (dS/dt) is the difference between the rate of salt entering the tank and the rate of salt leaving the tank. \n\nWhen the solution is oscillating about the constant level, we let this constant level be 'C'. Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

Given the rate of solution flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level, 'C'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average concentration of salt flowing into the tank.\n\nGiven the rate of concentration is 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal, to find the average concentration we must compute the average of this function over one period.\n\nStep 3: Given the average concentration and the fact that the rate of water flowing in and out is 2 gal/min, we can find the constant level 'C'.\n\nTo compute the average of a given function 'h(x)' over the interval [0,T] we must compute (1/T) * \u222bh(x) dx, T in [0,T].\n\nStep 4: Then, use the constant 'C' and the formula 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) to find the oscillation's amplitude.\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the average by calculating the integral between [0, 2 * pi] of 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). T in this case is 2 * pi because the function sin(t) has a period of 2 * pi.\n\nGiven that the average of the function over [0,2*pi] is average = 1/(2 * pi)* \u222b 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t))dt we deduce the following:\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* \u222b  1/4 + 1/8 sin(t) dt\n\n=  1/(2*pi)* [1/4t - 1/8cos(t)]\nCalculated on the interval [0, 2 * pi]\n\n=  1/(2 * pi) * [(2*pi/4 - 1/8cos(2*pi)) - (0/4 + 1/8 cos(0))].\n\nThis average =  1/4 + 0 \n\nThis average =  1/4\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average rate of flow equals this constant. \n\nSince we know that the rate of in- and out-flow is 2 gal/min and since the average concentration we found was 1/4 oz/gal we compute the average mass of the substance in the tank. This average = in- and out-flow rate * average concentration = 2 gal/min * 1/4 oz/gal = 0.5 oz/min\n\n\nWhen the system is oscillating about the constant level in a steady state that must mean the average mass of salt inside the tank equals the constant level times the in- and out-flow rate. Hence we can find C: C * 2 gal/min = 0.5 oz/min + 50 oz \n\nThen we solve for C, given in- and out-flow 2gal/min \n\nSolving for C we find the average concentration C = 0.24995gal. Now let's find the oscillation amplitude, let's denote 'A', using the equation 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) \n\nThen we solve for 'A', using the previously computed average 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). We must find the amplitude 'A' of the oscillation around the point 0.25, let's recall the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)). Then we let this function equal to 0.25 + A.\n\n\nSolution:\n \nFor the rate of concentration given by the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal we compute the oscillation amplitude by calculating the function in its maximum or minimum point.\n\nGiven the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) we deduce the following:\n\nRecall the function 1/4"

The correct way to calculate the amplitude 'A' is to find the maximum or minimum of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) oz/gal and then subtract the average concentration (which is the constant level 'C' around which the oscillation occurs).\n\nThe maximum value of the function 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * sin(t)) occurs when sin(t) = 1, which gives:\n\nmax value = 1/4 * (1 + 1/2 * 1) = 1/4 * (3/2) = 3/8 oz/gal\n\nThe amplitude 'A' is then the difference between the maximum value and the average concentration:\n\nA = max value - average concentration = (3/8) - (1/4) = (3/8) - (2/8) = 1/8 oz/gal\n\nSince the average concentration C = 0.24995 oz/gal (which is 1/4 oz/gal), the amplitude 'A' can also be expressed as a proportion of this value.\n\nWe have C = 1/4, so A = 1/8 = (1/2) * (1/4).
