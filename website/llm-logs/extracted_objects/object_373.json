This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1.

This law allows us to calculate the standard enthalpy change for a reaction by combining the formation enthalpies of the reactants and products.\n\nHess's law can be represented as:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f products) - \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f reactants)\n\nUsing the given formation enthalpies:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) = -19.32 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2) = -98.69 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) = -76.30 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(water) = -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) as follows:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = (2 * \u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2)) - (\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(water))\n= (-38.64 - 98.69) - (-76.30 - 68.32)\n= -137.33 - (-144.62)\n= -137.33 + 144.62\n= (144.62 - 137.33)\n= 7.29\n\nThe cancellation of terms can be seen as:\n(-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + (144.62)\nThis step allows us to simplify the calculation by combining the negative terms.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction is 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nMy improvement provides a slight rearrangement of the equations to make it clearer and more concise. The final answer remains the same.",

This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1. The formation reaction for the reactants:\n   Urea: C (s) + N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) + O (g) \u2192 H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \n   The \u2206H\u00b0_f for urea is given as -76.30 Kcal/mole\n   Water (H2O (l)): H2 (g) + (1/2)O2 (g) \u2192 H2O (l) \n   The \u2206H\u00b0_f for water is given as -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\n2.

This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1.

The addition of a conceptual explanation of Hess's law and its application to the reaction provides a helpful context for understanding the calculation.\n\nThe solution correctly applies Hess's law to calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2 (aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nUsing the given formation enthalpies:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) = -19.32 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2) = -98.69 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) = -76.30 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(water) = -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) as follows:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = (2 * \u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2)) - (\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(water))\n= (-38.64 - 98.69) - (-76.30 - 68.32)\n= -137.33 - (-144.62)\n= -137.33 + 144.62\n= (144.62 - 137.33)\n= 7.29\n\nThe cancellation of terms can be seen as:\n(-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + (144.62)\nThis step allows us to simplify the calculation by combining the negative terms.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction is 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe solution is already clear and concise, and the final answer is correct.\n\nHowever, I would suggest a minor clarification to the solution:\n\nWhen calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction, it's essential to use the correct sign convention. In this case, we subtract the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants from the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products.\n\nThis minor addition provides a clear understanding of the sign convention used in calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction.\n\nNo significant changes were made to the original solution. The correct steps were followed, and the solution still correctly applies Hess's law to calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThis solution provides a clear understanding of Hess's law and its application to the reaction, as well as the correct sign convention used in calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction.\n\nNo further improvements were made.

This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1.

This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1.

This law states that the total enthalpy change in a reaction is the same, regardless of the number of steps. \n\nFirst, let's write down the given reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2(aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nTo use Hess's law, we need to break down the reaction into the formation reactions for each component from the elements in their standard states. The standard enthalpy of formation (\u2206H\u00b0_f) is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements.\n\n1. The formation reaction for the reactants:\n   Urea: C (s) + N2 (g) + 3H2 (g) + O (g) \u2192 H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \n   The \u2206H\u00b0_f for urea is given as -76.30 Kcal/mole\n   Water (H2O (l)): H2 (g) + (1/2)O2 (g) \u2192 H2O (l) \n   The \u2206H\u00b0_f for water is given as -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\n2.

The addition of a conceptual explanation of Hess's law and its application to the reaction provides a helpful context for understanding the calculation.\n\nThe solution correctly applies Hess's law to calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2 (aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nUsing the given formation enthalpies:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) = -19.32 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2) = -98.69 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) = -76.30 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(water) = -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) as follows:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = (2 * \u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2)) - (\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(water))\n= (-38.64 - 98.69) - (-76.30 - 68.32)\n= -137.33 - (-144.62)\n= -137.33 + 144.62\n= (144.62 - 137.33)\n= 7.29\n\nThe cancellation of terms can be seen as:\n(-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + (144.62)\nThis step allows us to simplify the calculation by combining the negative terms.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction is 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe solution is already clear and concise, and the final answer is correct.\n\nHowever, I would suggest adding a minor clarification to the solution:\n\nHess's law can be represented as:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f products) - \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f reactants)\n\nWhich shows that the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction is the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants.\n\nThis minor addition provides a clear representation of Hess's law and its application to the reaction.\n\nNo significant changes were made to the original solution. The correct steps were followed, and the solution still correctly applies Hess's law to calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.",

In this case, we subtract the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants from the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products.\n\nThis minor addition provides a clear understanding of the sign convention used in calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction.\n\nHere's the improved solution:\n\nTo find the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction:\n\nH2O (l) + H2N - CO - NH2 (urea) \u2192 CO2 (aq) + 2NH3 (aq)\n\nWe can apply Hess's law, which states that the standard enthalpy change for a reaction is the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants. This law allows us to calculate the standard enthalpy change for a reaction by combining the formation enthalpies of the reactants and products.\n\nHess's law can be represented as:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f products) - \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f reactants)\n\nWhich shows that the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction is the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants.\n\nUsing the given formation enthalpies:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) = -19.32 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2) = -98.69 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) = -76.30 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(water) = -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) as follows:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = (2 * \u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2)) - (\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(water))\n= (-38.64 - 98.69) - (-76.30 - 68.32)\n= -137.33 - (-144.62)\n= -137.33 + 144.62\n= (144.62 - 137.33)\n= 7.29\n\nNote that we subtract the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants from the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products.\n\nThe cancellation of terms can be seen as:\n(-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + (144.62)\nThis step allows us to simplify the calculation by combining the negative terms.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction is 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThis solution provides a clear understanding of Hess's law and its application to the reaction, as well as the correct sign convention used in calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction.",

This law allows us to calculate the standard enthalpy change for a reaction by combining the formation enthalpies of the reactants and products.\n\nHess's law can be represented as:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f products) - \u03a3 (\u2206H\u00b0_f reactants)\n\nWhich shows that the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction is the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products minus the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants.\n\nUsing the given formation enthalpies:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) = -19.32 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2) = -98.69 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) = -76.30 Kcal/mole\n\u2206H\u00b0_f(water) = -68.32 Kcal/mole\n\nWe can calculate the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) as follows:\n\n\u2206H\u00b0 = (2 * \u2206H\u00b0_f(NH3) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(CO2)) - (\u2206H\u00b0_f(urea) + \u2206H\u00b0_f(water))\n= (-38.64 - 98.69) - (-76.30 - 68.32)\n= -137.33 - (-144.62)\n= -137.33 + 144.62\n= (144.62 - 137.33)\n= 7.29\n\nNote that we subtract the sum of the formation enthalpies of the reactants from the sum of the formation enthalpies of the products.\n\nThe cancellation of terms can be seen as:\n(-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + (144.62)\nThis step allows us to simplify the calculation by combining the negative terms.\n\nTherefore, the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for the reaction is 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThe final answer is B) 7.29 Kcal/mole.\n\nThis solution provides a clear understanding of Hess's law and its application to the reaction, as well as the correct sign convention used in calculating the standard enthalpy change (\u2206H\u00b0) for a reaction."
