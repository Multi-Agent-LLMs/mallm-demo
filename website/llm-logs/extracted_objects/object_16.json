In geometry, the supplement of an angle is another angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line).\n\nThe formula to find the supplement of an angle is: 180\u00b0 - given angle.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the supplement:\n\n180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 140\u00b0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Supplementary Example:**\n\n**Example:** Find the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle.\n\n**Solution:** Using the formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), we can calculate the supplement as follows:\n\n180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle is 105\u00b0.\n\n**Summary and Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo recap, the supplement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line). The formula to find the supplement of an angle is 180\u00b0 - given angle. This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding supplements can help solve various problems involving angles.\n\nThis solution remains the same, and I see no need to make any changes or improvements.",

The step-by-step explanation, starting from the definition of a supplement, presentation of the correct formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), and the straightforward calculation (180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0), leaves no room for confusion.\n\nI also appreciate the suggestion made by the Geometry Specialist and the additional example provided by the Geometry Student to further illustrate the concept of a supplement.

In geometry, the supplement of an angle is another angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line).\n\nThe formula to find the supplement of an angle is: 180\u00b0 - given angle.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the supplement:\n\n180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 140\u00b0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Supplementary Example:**\n\n**Example:** Find the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle.\n\n**Solution:** Using the formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), we can calculate the supplement as follows:\n\n180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle is 105\u00b0.\n\nThis reorganization provides a clear distinction between the original solution and the supplementary example, making it easier for students to understand and follow. The solution remains unchanged, but the additional example provides further clarification and reinforces the concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C",

In geometry, the supplement of an angle is another angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line).\n\nThe formula to find the supplement of an angle is: 180\u00b0 - given angle.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the supplement:\n\n180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 140\u00b0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Supplementary Example:**\n\n**Example:** Find the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle.\n\n**Solution:** Using the formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), we can calculate the supplement as follows:\n\n180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle is 105\u00b0.\n\n**Summary and Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo recap, the supplement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line). The formula to find the supplement of an angle is 180\u00b0 - given angle. This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding supplements can help solve various problems involving angles.\n\nWith this minor addition, the revised solution remains comprehensive, well-explained, and effectively communicates the geometric concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C"

The formula to find the supplement of an angle is 180\u00b0 - given angle. This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding supplements can help solve various problems involving angles.\n\nWith this minor addition, the revised solution remains comprehensive, well-explained, and effectively communicates the geometric concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C"

In geometry, the supplement of an angle is another angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line).\n\nThe formula to find the supplement of an angle is: 180\u00b0 - given angle.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the supplement:\n\n180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 140\u00b0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Supplementary Example:**\n\n**Example:** Find the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle.\n\n**Solution:** Using the formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), we can calculate the supplement as follows:\n\n180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle is 105\u00b0.\n\nThis reorganization provides a clear distinction between the original solution and the supplementary example, making it easier for students to understand and follow. The solution remains unchanged, but the additional example provides further clarification and reinforces the concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C",

In geometry, the supplement of an angle is another angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line).\n\nThe formula to find the supplement of an angle is: 180\u00b0 - given angle.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the supplement:\n\n180\u00b0 - 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 40\u00b0 angle is 140\u00b0, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Supplementary Example:**\n\n**Example:** Find the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle.\n\n**Solution:** Using the formula (180\u00b0 - given angle), we can calculate the supplement as follows:\n\n180\u00b0 - 75\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the supplement of a 75\u00b0 angle is 105\u00b0.\n\n**Summary and Key Takeaway:**\n\nTo recap, the supplement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, equals 180\u00b0 (a straight line). The formula to find the supplement of an angle is 180\u00b0 - given angle. This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding supplements can help solve various problems involving angles.\n\nWith this minor addition, the revised solution remains comprehensive, well-explained, and effectively communicates the geometric concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C"

The formula to find the supplement of an angle is 180\u00b0 - given angle. This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding supplements can help solve various problems involving angles.\n\nWith this minor addition, the revised solution remains comprehensive, well-explained, and effectively communicates the geometric concept of supplements.\n\nThe solution remains: C"
