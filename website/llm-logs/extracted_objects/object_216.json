Hence [1,2] isn't in the option list but that isn't possible since it does not have all the connections.\n\n minimum vertex cover can be found that has one more node.\n\n minimum vertex cover can be found that has one more node. If the extra node in the solution is the one that has the fewest connections to other nodes (one that isn't node 1 or node 2) (node 0 has connections that isn't node 1 or node 2: one that does not have the minimum number of connections other than either node that is a less number of connections: one that does not have minimum number of connections other than either option list [0,1] and [0,2]) then [H] is the answer based on option list.\n\n minimum vertex cover can be found that has one more node.

Nodes 1 and 2 cover most of the edges incident to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, which are <0,1>,<2,0>,<2,1>,<2,3>, and <1,3>. Node 4 is only connected to node 1, which is already covered by selecting node 1.\n\nA similar solution can be found that has one more node. If the extra node in the solution is the one that has the fewest connections to other nodes, that solution is still minimum.\n\nGiven nodes 1 and 2 cover all edges other than [4,1] then if we take either of these two nodes and also take a connection that connects either of these two nodes to a fourth node, node 4 is covered because <4,1> connect node 1 to node 4 but if this <4,1> does not exist then we need an alternate choice.\n\nHowever, node 4 is not connected to either node 0 or node 3 and hence alternate choices are [0,1,4] and [0,2,4] and are not an alternate choice.\n\nHowever, node 4 is not connected to either node 0 or node 3 and hence alternate choices are [1,3,4] which is an alternate choice.\n\nHowever, this choice that alternate with either either the node that has the most connections to other nodes and also the choice that alternate with the choice that has the least connections alternate with either node 3 or node 4 and choose either the choice that has the least connections alternate with either node 0 or one of the alternate choices are [1,3,4] which is an alternate choice.\n\nHence the answer actually is B.\n\nSolution: B"
