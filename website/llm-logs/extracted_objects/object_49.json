      "message": "[AGREE]\n\nI agree with the current solution. The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56",

The argument and calculations are well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand the solution.\n\nHowever, I can offer some minor improvements to enhance the clarity and readability of the solution:\n\n1. Consider adding a brief introduction to the problem, explaining the context and relevance of planar graphs and triangle-free planar graphs.\n\n2. After stating Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2), it might be helpful to remind the reader that we are given V = 30 and that our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\n3. When explaining the minimization of faces, it might be useful to mention that this approach is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\n4. In the calculation section, consider adding a brief sentence explaining why we are substituting E = 2F into Euler's formula, emphasizing that this represents the scenario where all faces have 4 edges.\n\nHere's an example of how these minor improvements could be implemented:\n\n**Improved Solution:**\n\nPlanar graphs have numerous applications in computer science, engineering, and mathematics, and understanding their properties is essential for solving various problems. In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nH) 56",

However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is 56. This result is obtained by applying Euler's formula and carefully considering the properties of planar graphs. The solution highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical concepts and relationships in graph theory, as well as the need for clear and rigorous reasoning.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. Understand the problem and the goal: Find the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices.\n2. Apply Euler's formula: Use the formula V - E + F = 2 to relate the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the graph.\n3. Minimize the number of faces: Assume that all faces have 4 edges to minimize the number of faces.\n4. Relate the number of edges to the number of faces: Use the relationship 2E >= 4F to relate the number of edges to the number of faces.\n5. Substitute the relationship into Euler's formula: Substitute E = 2F into Euler's formula to solve for E.\n\nFor further information on the properties of planar graphs and Euler's formula, please refer to the following sources:\n\n* [1] Bollob\u00e1s, B.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

Consider adding a brief introduction to the problem, explaining the context and relevance of planar graphs and triangle-free planar graphs.\n\n2. After stating Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2), it might be helpful to remind the reader that we are given V = 30 and that our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\n3. When explaining the minimization of faces, it might be useful to mention that this approach is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\n4. In the calculation section, consider adding a brief sentence explaining why we are substituting E = 2F into Euler's formula, emphasizing that this represents the scenario where all faces have 4 edges.\n\nHere's an example of how these minor improvements could be implemented:\n\n**Improved Solution:**\n\nPlanar graphs have numerous applications in computer science, engineering, and mathematics, and understanding their properties is essential for solving various problems. In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nH) 56",

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56",

The argument and calculations are well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand the solution.\n\nHowever, I can offer some minor improvements to enhance the clarity and readability of the solution:\n\n1. Consider adding a brief introduction to the problem, explaining the context and relevance of planar graphs and triangle-free planar graphs.\n\n2. After stating Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2), it might be helpful to remind the reader that we are given V = 30 and that our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\n3. When explaining the minimization of faces, it might be useful to mention that this approach is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\n4. In the calculation section, consider adding a brief sentence explaining why we are substituting E = 2F into Euler's formula, emphasizing that this represents the scenario where all faces have 4 edges.\n\nHere's an example of how these minor improvements could be implemented:\n\n**Improved Solution:**\n\nPlanar graphs have numerous applications in computer science, engineering, and mathematics, and understanding their properties is essential for solving various problems. In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nH) 56",

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is 56. This result is obtained by applying Euler's formula and carefully considering the properties of planar graphs. The solution highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical concepts and relationships in graph theory, as well as the need for clear and rigorous reasoning.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. Understand the problem and the goal: Find the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices.\n2. Apply Euler's formula: Use the formula V - E + F = 2 to relate the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the graph.\n3. Minimize the number of faces: Assume that all faces have 4 edges to minimize the number of faces.\n4. Relate the number of edges to the number of faces: Use the relationship 2E >= 4F to relate the number of edges to the number of faces.\n5. Substitute the relationship into Euler's formula: Substitute E = 2F into Euler's formula to solve for E.\n\nFor further information on the properties of planar graphs and Euler's formula, please refer to the following sources:\n\n* [1] Bollob\u00e1s, B.

However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case.

In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nH) 56",

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

In this task, we focus on triangle-free planar graphs, which are planar graphs that do not contain any triangles. We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is 56. This result is obtained by applying Euler's formula and carefully considering the properties of planar graphs. The solution highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical concepts and relationships in graph theory, as well as the need for clear and rigorous reasoning.\n\nFor further information on the properties of planar graphs and Euler's formula, please refer to the following sources:\n\n* [1] Bollob\u00e1s, B.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces.

              "content": "To solve this, we'll use the concept that a planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, and a triangle-free planar graph is one that doesn't contain any triangles.\n\nA key property of planar graphs is given by Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWe're given V = 30. To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

We are given a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices and asked to find the maximum number of edges.\n\nTo approach this problem, we use Euler's formula, which states that for a planar graph with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, the following equation holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nWe are given V = 30, and our goal is to maximize E while minimizing F.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges per face is 4, as any face with 3 edges would form a triangle. To minimize the number of faces, we assume that all faces have 4 edges. This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces. Since we want to minimize the number of faces, we will assume that all faces have 4 edges, which implies that E = 2F.\n\nNow, we can substitute this relationship into Euler's formula:\n\n30 - E + F = 2\n30 - 2F + F = 2\n30 - F = 2\nF = 28\n\nSince E = 2F, we can calculate the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices is 56. This result is obtained by applying Euler's formula and carefully considering the properties of planar graphs. The solution highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical concepts and relationships in graph theory, as well as the need for clear and rigorous reasoning.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. Understand the problem and the goal: Find the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph with 30 vertices.\n2. Apply Euler's formula: Use the formula V - E + F = 2 to relate the number of vertices, edges, and faces in the graph.\n3. Minimize the number of faces: Assume that all faces have 4 edges to minimize the number of faces.\n4. Relate the number of edges to the number of faces: Use the relationship 2E >= 4F to relate the number of edges to the number of faces.\n5. Substitute the relationship into Euler's formula: Substitute E = 2F into Euler's formula to solve for E.\n\nFor further information on the properties of planar graphs and Euler's formula, please refer to the following sources:\n\n* [1] Bollob\u00e1s, B.

To maximize the number of edges E, we need to minimize the number of faces F, since they're inversely related according to Euler's formula.\n\nIn a triangle-free planar graph, the minimum number of edges of any face is 4, because if there were a face with only 3 edges, it would form a triangle, which isn't allowed.\n\nThus, assuming the minimization of faces and all faces having 4 edges, we have 2E >= 4F, because each edge belongs to exactly two faces.\n\nRearrange the inequality above, and then substitute into Euler's formula:\n \nWe know that 4F = 2E (to keep faces at a minimum) or E = 2F, so plugging it into Euler's formula, we obtain that:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \nso \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\n30 - F = 2,\nso \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n \nH) 56"

The reasoning provided is thorough, and the steps taken to minimize the number of faces while maximizing the number of edges in a triangle-free planar graph are sound.\n\nTo improve the current solution, I can add a few more explanations and observations:\n\nFirstly, let's recall that in any planar graph, the number of edges E is bounded by the Handshaking Lemma: 2E =-sum(degree(v)), where degree(v) is the number of edges incident on vertex v. However, to apply the Handshaking Lemma, we need information about the degree sequence of the vertices, which is not available in this case. Thus, we will stick to Euler's formula.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the minimum number of edges in any face is 4 implies that the graph is a \"quadrangulation\" of a plane if all faces have 4 edges. In fact, the assumption that all faces have 4 edges can be proven to be the case if the graph is a simple, triangle-free planar graph.\n\nTo further invigorate the explanation, we can establish a strict upper bound. The given 4F = 2E assumption minimizes the faces (as a 3-edge face isn't acceptable) as doing otherwise may create triangles.\n\nGiven this context, our steps align perfectly to invigorate the established bond:\n \n30 - E + F = 2, \n136 so \n30 - 2F + F = 2,\nand 126 \n30 - F = 2,\n148 so \nF = 28 or,\n \nE = 2 * F = 2 * 28 = 56.\n\nOur computation outputs that if all faces have 4-edges, the number of faces will be minimized at 28, implying that E = 2 * 28 = 56, which serves as a strict proof that a 30 vertex triangle-free planar graph will be of maximum 56 edges.\n\nTherefore, I propose invigorating our answer solution not proposing a modification as the mathematical underpinnings had been aptly invigorated.\n \n The strict answer to our question thus - choosing an equivalent from the solution options provided, will be:\n \nH) 56"

This is motivated by the desire to avoid triangles and create a planar graph with as few faces as possible.\n\nUsing the relationship 2E >= 4F, we can relate the number of edges to the number of faces.
