The improvement doesn't alter the final answer but adds more clarity and a note about a common mistake to watch out for.\n\nThe current solution correctly applies the formula for variance of a uniform distribution and arrives at the correct answer. However, a small improvement can be made to emphasize the importance of checking whether the interval [0, 3] represents the support of a continuous uniform distribution or a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nThe correct solution assumes that X is a continuous uniform random variable, and the variance formula (b - a)\u00b2 / 12 applies only to continuous uniform distributions. If X had been a discrete uniform random variable, the variance formula would have been different.\n\nHere's an improved version:\n\n**Improved Solution:**\n\nTo find the variance of a random variable X that is uniformly distributed over the interval [0, 3], we first note that X is a continuous uniform random variable.\n\nThe formula for variance (\u03c3\u00b2) of a continuous uniform distribution is:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = (b - a)\u00b2 / 12\n\nwhere a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the interval.\n\nIn this case, a = 0 and b = 3.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 = (3 - 0)\u00b2 / 12\n\u03c3\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 / 12\n\u03c3\u00b2 = 9 / 12\n\u03c3\u00b2 = 3 / 4\n\nSo, the variance of X is 3/4, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Note:** When applying the formula, make sure to check whether the random variable X represents a continuous or discrete uniform distribution. The formula (b - a)\u00b2 / 12 only applies to continuous uniform distributions. For discrete uniform distributions, a different formula should be used.\n\nThe improved solution emphasizes the importance of clarifying whether the distribution is continuous or discrete, which makes the explanation more robust.\n\nThe final solution remains: C.",

The step-by-step process followed by the Probability Theorist and reiterated by other experts, including myself, is correct and precise.\n\nTo further reinforce this, I'll summarize the key points again:\n\n1. The correct formula for variance of a uniform distribution is (b - a)\u00b2 / 12.\n2. The interval [0, 3] has lower bound a = 0 and upper bound b = 3.\n3. Substituting these values into the formula gives us (3 - 0)\u00b2 / 12.\n4. Simplifying this expression yields 9 / 12.\n5. Further simplifying the fraction, we get 3 / 4.\n\nThe calculated variance of 3 / 4 matches option C.

The step-by-step process followed by the Probability Theorist and reiterated by other experts, including myself, is correct and precise.\n\nTo further reinforce this, I'll summarize the key points again:\n\n1. The correct formula for variance of a uniform distribution is (b - a)\u00b2 / 12.\n2. The interval [0, 3] has lower bound a = 0 and upper bound b = 3.\n3. Substituting these values into the formula gives us (3 - 0)\u00b2 / 12.\n4. Simplifying this expression yields 9 / 12.\n5. Further simplifying the fraction, we get 3 / 4.\n\nThe calculated variance of 3 / 4 matches option C.

The step-by-step process followed by the Probability Theorist and reiterated by other experts, including myself, is correct and precise.\n\nTo further reinforce this, I'll summarize the key points again:\n\n1. The correct formula for variance of a uniform distribution is (b - a)\u00b2 / 12.\n2. The interval [0, 3] has lower bound a = 0 and upper bound b = 3.\n3. Substituting these values into the formula gives us (3 - 0)\u00b2 / 12.\n4. Simplifying this expression yields 9 / 12.\n5. Further simplifying the fraction, we get 3 / 4.\n\nThe calculated variance of 3 / 4 matches option C.
