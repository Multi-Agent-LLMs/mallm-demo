It is defined as:\n\n\u03b2 = -(1/V) * (\u2202V/\u2202p) at constant T\n\nThe ideal gas equation is given by:\n\npV = nRT\n\nTo find the partial derivative of V with respect to p at constant T, we first rearrange the equation to solve for V:\n\nV = nRT / p\n\nNow, we can find the partial derivative of V with respect to p:\n\n\u2202V/\u2202p = \u2202(nRT/p)/\u2202p = -nRT/p^2\n\nSubstitute this expression into the equation for \u03b2:\n\n\u03b2 = -(1/V) * (-nRT/p^2)\n= (1/V) * (nRT/p^2)\n\nSubstituting V = nRT/p:\n\n\u03b2 = (1/(nRT/p)) * (nRT/p^2)\n= (p/nRT) * (nRT/p^2)\n= 1/p\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we confirm that:\n\nJ) (1/p)\n\nis indeed the correct expression for the coefficient of compressibility at constant temperature for an ideal gas.\n\nThe final expression for the coefficient of compressibility at constant temperature for an ideal gas is \u03b2 = 1/p, which matches option J.\n\nSolution: J)"
